Musicality & Accents
By: Jose Ordonez and Dhruv Puri

YAY!!!!
What is Musicality?
The quality or state of being musical; feeling and interpreting the music

Dancing to the melody, accents, variations of               rhythm, and mood

Our bodies are to make visible the sounds               we hear
INTERMEDIATE DANCERS LISTEN UP!
MUSICALITY Basics
Energy level           vs        tempo

1  2  3 -  4 
5  6  7    8  

Accents
Performances use them a lot.

Listen to the Music
ACTIVELY listen to the music! On and off the dance floor!

TUNE into the music rather than focusing on patterns and   	 styling

Are you on TIME? do your patterns and styling match the	music, highlight accents, respect the breaks?

The Instruments

Clave
Singer
Timbales
Cowbell
Piano
Bongos
Congas
Guiro
Maracas
Bass
Trumpet
Know the Instruments

Knowing the different instruments
 
how they interact with one another will enhance your ability to stay on time 

enhance your ability/confidence to begin playing with the music


Understand the Structure
Listen to the structure and patterns leading up to breaks, accents, etc..

Know your way around in a song; like you know the 	 different rooms in your house

Know where the bathroom is and how to use it...how to flush...clean up...etc

Don’t potty outside or in your pants...wait for the bathroom to become available

Don’t Ignore the Breaks!
IF the music stops OR slows down, 
THEN drastically slow down or stop halfway…

began your move once the music picks up again 

Adjust your moves to the music



Aaaayyy!!!
Reflect the Mood...
Beyond the structure of a song there is always a certain “feel” to it

The music can “drive” and power you, or get you to relax and chill

Make an emotional connection with the music

A romantic song is likely to be soft and flowy… so feel lovely and sensitive 

Be one with the music
The Clave
A rhythm:
Arguably the most important/core rhythm in salsa.
Clave Rhythm
Son Clave
A group of 2 hits, then a group of 3 hits.
Note: Reverse for “3-2” clave




Clap Along!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsTfm1xIvPA

Rumba Clave
     3rd note of the group of three is late





   Listen: ‘Intro del Mayimbe’ - Mayimbe
Son vs Rumba Clave
Son “2-3”




Rumba
Accents
Ponche
The third clave hit in the group of 3.
Often, the accent is carried to the next measure




What to do?
Step harder, hold your pose a bit longer

Ponche (Cont.)
How do you tell when a ponche is coming?
Listen!

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 … 2 + 3
						  x x             X
		or				  x    x    x    X

	x= hit		X = ponche!		‘…’ = hold

Listen to: ‘Timbamania’ - Mayimbe
Trecillo
Listen: ‘El Diablo’ - Mayimbe (3:20)

Nicholas Burt
	To complete this assignment, I attended a Bachata night at Ashkenaz on the night of October 4th. I also brought along my roommate who is not in the Salsa DeCal and had never danced Bachata prior to the event. What unfolded was a crazy mix of professional dancers and beginners like myself. It honestly was completely different than dancing at the DeCal, a much tougher and difficult process that at times left me unmotivated to continue. Dancers all around me were lite on their feet and could easily string together moves while I mostly danced along the sidelines trying to remember what moves we had been taught in class. I ended up staying for over two and a half hours, getting the full scope of the event.
	The event met my expectations, but in other ways left me frustrated with my lack of knowledge in Salsa and Bachata. Watching other dancers move between dancers with fluidity and ease drove me to make the goal of trying to dance Bachata or Salsa once a week regardless if I made the DeCal. This goal is now paying off as I feel like I am less restrained to the basic step movements and enjoy making moves up on the fly. This was the greatest challenge for me earlier in the semester, where I thought of each move in terms of the individual steps and forgot about the larger picture. Once I had forgotten about the dance, I regressed into my head and would forget the moves in their entirety. After watching the other Bachata dancers, I realized that they just move to the song and don’t worry whether their hitting every mark. Instead, they are embracing the dance for what it is and having fun with it. I now find myself embracing this side of dancing more so than I had previously and have also witnessed a general improvement in my style since. Had I not attended this event, I would never have gained a larger perspective on Salsa and Bachata.

	Before coming to Berkeley, I never went out dancing. When I signed up for this class, I knew I would have to get out of my comfort zone but I did not expect to actually go social dancing. The first event I attended was the Gio’s event. I personally did not feel comfortable and automatically started thinking that social dancing was just not for me. I only stayed for a few minutes and then decided to go home. I feel like the reason I did not get to enjoy myself was because I was still insecure about my dancing ability. Later in the semester, I learned about a different event Salsa at Cal was going to have. At first I did not want to go because I thought it would similar to my last experience. I was then convinced to give social dancing a second chance. 
	
The second event I attended was Salsa at Sproul. The environment was completely different to the that of Gio’s. I was very glad I attended the event because it completely changed my perspective on social dancing. I was able to meet new people, all with different skill levels. I was really surprise when I dance with a guy who had been dancing for most of his life. I told him I was a beginner in advance just so he would know why I wasn't necessarily the best at dancing. He told me that it was fine and went on leading the dance. He did some crazy moves and I was actually able to follow. After dancing with a few guys who were highly skilled, I felt like I had learned more. I felt that I was able to follow more easily and read the signs for certain turns better. I really enjoyed the last social dancing event I attended and can definitely see myself attending more in the future.

A few weeks ago (November 1st) I went to Bachata Nightz at Ashkenaz. I didn’t get there in time for the lesson with Kathy Reyes, but I enjoyed a good 2.5 hours at the social dance part. I think that, for the most part, the event matched the image I had in my head before going. Although the music played in class doesn’t seem like a band is playing it, I typically associate Bachata or any live dance with an accompanying live band. Having DJMigz spin the beats was a really cool experience. It seemed like he incorporated quite a few different styles of bachata, and since we’ve talked about the differences in lecture recently, I was able to listen for them and then joke with my partners about being good enough to try to change the way we danced to match the style/region of the music being played. I think having a DJ over a live band definitely boosted the vibe of a nightclub, which is more youthful and “sexy”, if you will. This vibe made for a great first live exposure for any social dance (besides high school/middle school dances that have their own “dance” culture, lol). I think that Bachata Nightz definitely emulated the social aspect of the dance much better than in class. Having complete strangers come up to me to ask to dance was different and a little intimidating for me at first since dancing, especially bachata, seems like a rather intimate thing to do with a complete stranger, but I also think that’s the beauty behind it. Since there was much less of a focus on technique at Bachata Nightz and I felt comfortable actually following my follow (since they each were pretty experienced), I felt like I could let loose more and focus more on the enjoyment and connection with my partner aspects rather than, “Are we doing this move correctly?” Not following a series of choreography felt less technical, but I also had much more fun. A few of my partners dipped me, which was so awesome for me to do, and I definitely felt more comfortable/experienced than some of the other people there who acted like they had never seen bachata before. Overall, I had a really great time. The environment was super friendly and inviting and my partners were all very laid back and enjoyable. I am looking forward to December 6th (the next Bachata Nightz) very much!!

Sydney Holgado
	Social dancing is quite honestly the motivation with which I applied for this DeCal and joined Salsa at Cal.  My first experience social dancing was far before my first class, when I accidentally stepped onto the dance floor at a salsa club in Madrid.  I was immediately asked to dance and with no idea what the basic step was, I completely embarrassed myself.  Then when I went to my first Open Practica about a year ago I had a goal to use what I would learn to never be that embarrassed again.  I pretty much forgot about that goal until recently when I went social dancing at Ashkenaz for Bachata Nights.   I was on the dance floor being crazily twirled by someone I’d just met and realized that I didn’t care about this whole “embarrassment” thing anymore but instead I was just having so much fun. (This is so cheesy I know sorry). The expectations that I’d set from that first brief experience accidentally social dancing had been shattered over the past year.  
I still get nervous sometimes when I go out and I know that I’m far less experienced than my dance partner, but I’ve tried to build confidence in OP and in the DeCal and the people I’ve met through Salsa at Cal have been instrumental in helping me build that confidence by being patient with me, giving helpful tips, or just hyping me up.  Again this is cheesy and a bit of a ramble but my main takeaway from my social dancing experiences is to not set hard expectations because growing and improving is so fun on its own and happens more when you just go with the flow.

Gregoria Millensifer
	Social dancing is the best part of latin dancing, at least for me it is.  You get to meet new people, try out new moves, enjoy the music, and it’s all such a fun experience.  I have been to a many social dancing nights but the night I reflected on most was Salsa at Cal’s first social event at Gio’s on the twenty-first of September.  The reason why this particular social night ended up being a reflection on social dancing wasn’t because of this paper, but because I got to bring Zac, my boyfriend, and he gave me his perspective of the night as well.  For me, the night was loads of fun; I got to dance with students from the decal and people outside of the class as well.  For Zac, however, the night was bit daunting.
	At the event, I danced with everyone.  I am intermediate at latin dancing, so many times I ended up dancing with someone who knew more moves than I did.  Whenever someone led me into a new move and I messed up, they would let me know what they were trying to do and lead it again so that we may try again.  When I would complete the moves, I felt very accomplished.  I also danced with students from the DeCal, and we would laugh together if we messed up and give ourselves praise when we completed moves we learned in the class.
During the night, I realized that social dancing wasn’t such an exhilarating experience I thought it was to everyone because Zac seemed nervous.  We had been to open practicas before, but this night ended up being more chaotic for him.  He told me that he felt nervous about his dancing because he was a beginner and felt that he was not a good enough dancer.  I dragged his booty to the dance floor and told him all he needed was the basic steps and a good mood.  Because it was difficult for me to teach him new moves as a intermediate follower, we ended up sticking to the basics, which he perfected by the end of the night.  It was fun to teach him the moves I had learned and the night ended up being a great experience for the both of us, regardless of experience.

Hello,

My name is Gregoria, I'm a board member of Salsa at Cal I recently heard about [recent even the club did] and I wanted to learn more about [club].   I think it would be great for our communities to connect and support each other at Berkeley. 

A little about us, Salsa at Cal is a family of dancers who are looking to grow our Latin Dance community. We offer free events and dance lessons for people of all levels. We also have social nights where we try to reach out to the greater Berkeley community. 

As a growing community, we would love to welcome members of [insert club here] to our next meeting or a coffee chat.  Let me know if you might be interested and we can setup some times. 

Best Regards,
Gregoria and the Salsa At Cal Familia

My most recent dancing experience outside of the Salsa DeCal was the Fall Fiesta at Gio’s on October 19. It was definitely different from dancing at the DeCal or even from dancing during office hours. The dancing was structureless, energetic, and quicker which I really enjoyed though I had a hard time keeping up with the more experienced dancers. 
I think this event did just about meet my expectations. It was my first time at Gio’s so I didn’t really know what to expect. The venue was very nice and the environment was very lively and entertaining. I arrived two hours after the event started; I missed the one hour lesson and the first hour of social dancing. Once I arrived, there wasn’t any salsa or bachata songs playing until about 4-5 songs later. However, it was great to hear how the music varied. I think that made the event much more enjoyable and energetic, it allowed myself and other explore different types of dancing.
I applied essentially everything I learned in lecture and from dance class. All my moves came from dance class but by dancing with others, I did learn a few new moves and learned to more easily adjusted to different styles and rhythms. I really enjoyed being able to dance with people with different levels of experience. I learned so much from this event and I think I even left feeling a little more confident in my dancing abilities. Now, I certainly understand when the DeCal instructors say that social dancing helps make a dancer. 
Though this event was not exactly how I imagined it would be, I really enjoyed myself and would not turn down the chance to attend another salsa at Gio’s event. I believe the Salsa DeCal really prepared me for this social event and I am looking forward to checking out future social dancing events, including dancing something other than salsa.

	To complete this assignment, I attended a Bachata night at Ashkenaz on the night of October 4th. I also brought along my roommate who is not in the Salsa DeCal and had never danced Bachata prior to the event. What unfolded was a crazy mix of professional dancers and beginners like myself. It honestly was completely different than dancing at the DeCal, a much tougher and difficult process that at times left me unmotivated to continue. Dancers all around me were lite on their feet and could easily string together moves while I mostly danced along the sidelines trying to remember what moves we had been taught in class. I ended up staying for over two and a half hours, getting the full scope of the event.
	The event met my expectations, but in other ways left me frustrated with my lack of knowledge in Salsa and Bachata. Watching other dancers move between dancers with fluidity and ease drove me to make the goal of trying to dance Bachata or Salsa once a week regardless if I made the DeCal. This goal is now paying off as I feel like I am less restrained to the basic step movements and enjoy making moves up on the fly. This was the greatest challenge for me earlier in the semester, where I thought of each move in terms of the individual steps and forgot about the larger picture. Once I had forgotten about the dance, I regressed into my head and would forget the moves in their entirety. After watching the other Bachata dancers, I realized that they just move to the song and don’t worry whether their hitting every mark. Instead, they are embracing the dance for what it is and having fun with it. I now find myself embracing this side of dancing more so than I had previously and have also witnessed a general improvement in my style since. Had I not attended this event, I would never have gained a larger perspective on Salsa and Bachata.

To gain dance experience outside of the decal and open practica, I attended Salsa on Sproul on October 12th. Even though it was still on campus, it felt different from dancing at the decal. Instead of the usual people and moves from class every week, I met new people who danced with moves and styles I had never seen before. In addition, I danced with people at very different levels than my own; some taught me new moves and others had never danced salsa before. When a bachata song came on, my partner had never heard of bachata before so I got to show them a little bit of what I had learned from the decal. 
On the other hand, it was also fun to apply what I already knew. The first hour lesson was entirely things that the beginner class had already learned before, so I got to help some people figure out the moves and to keep improving on what I’d learned. I also was able to apply information from lecture; a cuban song came on before we had been taught any cuban moves, but by the way my partner was dancing I could tell we were doing cuban salsa from the lecture on different styles of dance! Having a partner that knew how to do cuban salsa was a cool experience because he was able to teach me a series of different moves. 
Overall, the event definitely met my expectations. I was nervous to dance on Sproul in front of other students walking by, but once the music started playing that all went away. I felt like I learned a lot of new things and applied all of the old knowledge I had and wasn’t afraid to mess up in front of other people! While the decal never feels limiting, the more social environment of salsa on sproul made me feel less limited to the moves and partners I know and feel like I was able to jump in and learn new things along the way. Next up is being able to make it to a Gio’s night!

	I went to the salsa on sproul event, where people from the decal and others social danced on the steps of sproul. The event started off with a lesson on basics and then moved on to social dancing. I found social dancing to be much more difficult than dancing in the decal because in the decal we usually learn combos and practice those which allows me to kind of have planned what to do. In social dancing it was much more on the fly and I found it more difficult to time and execute  different combos. Also leading was more difficult because in practice everyone shares a common knowledge of the combos and the followers know what’s coming next. In social dancing I found that I need to be much more clear as a lead in signaling what move is coming next. 
	The event was a lot of fun and definitely met my expectations. It was also fun to dance with people form the beginners class as the two classes usually don’t mix that often. I applied a lot of the moves that we have learned in class but found that a lot of them were more difficult than normal because of the limited space available. In class we have a lot of space to due the spins and all the different moves that are necessary form combos, however at the salsa on sproul event there were a lot more people and I had to learn to take smaller steps when dancing. Something that I did not expect to be so difficult that I struggled with was always staying on the 1 beat throughout the whole song. Especially if there was a slight mess up and we became offbeat I found it more difficult than expected to get back on. I think practicing in social settings is definitely one of the best ways to improve and sort of one of the only ways to identify what you need to improve on. 
	Overall I had a great time at salsa on sproul and thought it was a great way to sort of introduce salsa at cal to people on campus. I noticed a lot of people stopping to watch and even participate in the dancing!

Unfortunately, auditing the class is not an option under these circumstances. However, if you are not able to attend the DeCal this semester, there are other Salsa at Cal events that will be hosted later in the semester that we encourage you to attend!

Office Hours
We host Office Hours every Tuesday after class from 9PM-10PM in Social Sciences Building 402. It’s super casual and fun, we hope to see you there! 

Enrollment Logistics 
By Friday September 15th, you should have been enrolled into SOCIOL198 on CalCentral and you should have gotten a notification on bCourses that you have been enrolled in SOCIOL 198 (History, Culture and Practice of Salsa Dance). If you have not been enrolled by then, please let us know. All late fees waived. 


Thank you for applying - we are excited to dance with you!



Dear Salsa DeDal Applicant,


We are sorry to inform you that we are unable to offer you a spot in this semester’s Salsa at Cal DeCal. 


This Fall 2023 semester, we received 190 Beginner Section applications, with a capacity to host only 36. Please know we appreciate your interest in this class and the time you put into applying for our DeCal. We reviewed all applications exhaustively. Unfortunately, there was a high volume of applicants and we had to decline many students who applied; auditing the class is not an option under current circumstances. However, we strongly encourage you to reapply next semester and stay connected with us on social media to get updates on all future events and other opportunities to dance with Salsa at Cal outside of our DeCal! 

We are flattered by your interest in our DeCal and the amazing art that is Latin dance. Thank you for the effort you put into applying.

Course Description

Students will learn about a variety of topics related to dance as a medium for social interaction between individuals and groups of people. 
Dance! The dance instruction part of each class will be a series taught by the course facilitators and occasional guest instructors. Beginner and intermediate students are taught separately.

Asking Someone to Dance
Be clear on who you’re asking.
Ask one partner at a time.
Ask as many people as possible!
Make eye contact, be inviting, and offer your hand.
If declined:
Don’t take it personally
Ask someone else
Ask at the beginning of a song

Declining
If you respond “next song,” mean it!

Don’t decline someone and then accept someone else for the same song

Try to accept as many dances as possible!

Polite ways to decline:
“No thank you”
“No thank you, I’m taking a break”
“No thank you, I’m getting a drink”


Activity:
Asking someone
to dance!
During the Dance
Dance at the level of your partner
Make beginners feel comfortable
Dancing with a wide variety of dancers at different levels makes you better!
Try to avoid teaching others or asking for lessons on the dance floor.
Be aware of your surroundings. 
Don’t take more floor space than you need.
Apologize if you bump another couple.
During the Dance
Enjoy yourself!
Smile!
Small talk/asking their name is okay
Eye contact is a good thing (but don’t stare!)
If you’re feelin it, sing it!

DON’T:
Say: “Wow, this is a long song!”
Count out loud
Stare at your feet

If you feel uncomfortable, its OK to walk away.
After the Dance
Say “thank you”
You can ask for another dance later!

Don’t give unsolicited dancing advice

If you are exchanging numbers, move off the dancefloor
Remember:
Be yourself!
Don’t compare yourself to others!
Have fun!

Salsa DeCal Mid-Semester Evaluation

We are halfway through the semester and the facilitators would like you to take some time to give us feedback. Your feedback is very important to us. Please take this evaluation seriously as we will use your feedback to shape how we teach both next semester’s DeCal and the remainder of this semester. 

The Academic Section:
1.) What do you think we do well? Are there any particular lectures that you especially enjoyed? Why?









2.) What do you think we could improve on, or do differently? Are there any particular lectures or parts of lectures you did not like, and why?









3.) Bearing in mind that we MUST give you assignments in order to give you one unit of credit, what do you think about the writing we’ve asked you to do? Anything we could do differently?









4.) Do you have any further suggestions, comments, criticisms? 








The Dance Section:
Circle one of each: 	I am a leader / follower in the beginner / intermediate class.

3.) What do you think your instructors do well? Are there any particular features of the dance class that you enjoy or think they do that is particularly helpful? Why?





4.) What do you think your instructors should do differently? Are there any things they taught you or asked you to do that you thought were especially unhelpful?


 



5.) Are there any particular things you want your instructors to teach you? This can be a particular salsa step, or style.





6.) What do you think about the goals? Do you think your instructors are helping you accomplish them? 






7.) Do you have any further suggestions, comments, criticisms? 





Overall:
How do you feel about the overall direction of the course so far? Do you have anything else you would like us to know?






*As you know, Salsa at Cal is a student run club. If you’d be interested in helping keep the club running, please
approach or email us. We’re always looking for interested students to help out!*

Event: (Title, date, location)
Salsaween, October 27, 2017, Hearst Gym
 
Amount requested:
 
Brief description of the event: This is a free event where we teach students the Salsa basics and provide them with a social environment in which they can practice these skills.
 
Who will be attending the event? How many will be attending? Why are they attending?
 
Both undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in Latin dancing attend our events. While students are usually intimidated by the prospect of social dancing, we’ve managed to create a welcoming environment for all dance levels by providing lessons at the beginning of our events. This allows all students to participate at some level.  On average 150 people attend the event.
 
 
How would you advertise/market this event? Is this an existing event that happens every year or semester? If so, please describe the success the event has had in the past.
 
This event has been held every fall semester and has been very successful, with an average of 150 people attending every year.  In order to advertise this event we use a combination of social media and traditional flyering. We advertise our event on Facebook at least once a week and currently have around 400 people interested in this years event. We also announce the event to students in the Decal and those who attend our weekly event, Salsa on Sproul. Leading up to the event we also increase the amount of days we flyer on sproul; flyering around 2-3 days per week.
 
 
Why do you deserve a grant from the Arts and Creativity Fund? Describe how your event will promote artistic endeavors at UC Berkeley.
 
We deserve a grant from the Arts and Creativity Fund because we provide a safe and inclusive space for all students to express themselves through dance.
 
Our event promotes artistic endeavors at UC Berkeley by exposing students to different types of dance outside of their culture. We simultaneously provide Latinx/Chicanx students with an environment in which they can feel and be themselves.
 
Please upload a detailed, itemized budget (including other sources of funding and all expenses).

Total: $305
We can ask for up to $500 so I added the decorations so we could ask for more money, add anything that’s somewhat reasonable (I don’t think the fog machine is reasonable but wasn’t sure what else to put…) 
 
dj: $150 for the night (let’s pretend we pay dhru lol) 
decorations:  
$9 Spider web https://www.amazon.com/Fun-World-Stretch-Spider-Outdoor/dp/B00624MP2Y/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1508289430&sr=8-4&keywords=spider+web+decorations

Casa Zimbabwe has gone through many incarnations over the years since its construction in the 1960s as both the first building designed specifically to be a student co-op, and the first in the nation to be co-ed.
Currently, most members have lost count of the number of different lives CZ has led, but it is safe to say that the building, its… Read More

Berkeley, CA 94704

Originally built in the late 19th century for the attorney of the storied Hearst Family, this resplendent manor was one of the first homes to grace Panoramic Hill.

Euclid Hall
14 Singles - 5 Doubles - 24 Residents

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights did a very wonderful job at portraying the hostility between Americans and Cubans during the Cuban Revolution. Furthermore, It successfully counters such preconceived hostility and racism between the two nations with the relationship between our two main characters, Katey Miller and Javier; one American and one Cuban. However, I find several details in the movie cliche and could have been illustrated in a much more realistic and interesting way. For example, Having only been exposed to Cuban culture and its people for a very short period of time,  Katey empathizes and falls in love with Javier rather quickly. The process of Katey getting to know Javier and eventually falling in love with him through dancing could have been conveyed through a much more interesting and captivating way.
	Overall,  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights successfully explores the duality of blind hatred and innocent love between people from two opposing nations. Nevertheless, the innocent love between Katey and Javier  and the connection they felt from dancing with each other could have been portrayed in a much better way by the director, Guy Ferland. The dancing scenes was not very outstanding compared to a normal scene even though it is a movie about dancing. The camera often zooms out and fails to capture their beautiful movements and close connections. Guy Ferland chooses to portray dancing through a cliche lense and fails to capture my attention because of that. Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights has a plot with enormous potential but the director failed to realize.

	The movie Dirty Dancing has to main characters who are “Javier” and “Katye”. This movie takes place in cuba while the country is in the middle of a revolution. It was very interesting to see how to completely different people were able to like each other and be able to put there love into dancing with a passion.
	This movie was actually really good in my opinion. I really liked about the movie how funny it was. There were so many funny moments in the movie that made me laugh hard. I also liked how they used two different people with totally different lives to be able to get to know each other and eventually fall in love. I did not like how white people were portrayed in the movie. White people were made seen as the ones that had ultimate power.
	My favorite part of the movie was when Javier and Katye started to practice for the contest and they were starting to like each other. It was beautiful to see 2 different people fall in love, whom they had the same passion of dancing. Seeing them dance at the end with all of that passion, having that bonding with each other, moving along the floor with the flawless connection was just great to see.
	I feel like I relate to Javier in a lot of small or big aspects. Javier is from Cuba and I’m from Mexico. Javier started working from a small age and I did as well. I had my first job when I was 8 years old in Mexico and I also worked fixing cars. Javier was a big part of his family and he was basically the man of the house. For me it was almost the same as well. My dad would leave to work at three in the morning and before he would leave he would wake me up and tell me that when he was gone i was the man of the house.

Dirty Dancing Havana Nightz 
	Much like its counterpart, Dirty Dancing Havana Nightz consists of a love story built on the foundation of dance, but instead of opposition only from class disputes the Havana Nightz version shows the racism between white Americans and the Cuban population. What I really appreciated about this version of Dirty Dancing was that it focused on the dispute between the Cubans and the Americans that were practically taking over Cuba and building hotels and casinos that paid the corrupt representatives of Cuba. I was intrigued to see how the dancing was ingrained in the soul of the Cuba. The movie took place in an extremely tumultuous political time in the history of Cuba. The leaders of the country were corrupt and funneling money into their pockets instead of making job opportunities for the population. There was extreme military intervention to prevent an uprising, they burned books, kidnapped people form their own homes, and allowed the Americans to profit off of the land while corrupting the lower class.   
One of the bigger downfalls of the movie was how minimal the character development was. It is hard to believe the love scenes because we did not know the characters that well. When there was character development the scenes seemed rushed. I understand that the was a lower budget movie and that was probably why some of the scenes felt rushed. 
Overall, I liked the movie. It was a cute typical love story with a better back story than the original. The dancing scenes were my favorite (even more than the original movie) they had amazing chemistry and I loved the interactions with the lead characters when first starting to dance together. I was surprised to see Patrick Swayze in the movie.

	Rebellion, dancing, romance, heartbreak, drama.  How could anyone not enjoy the movie Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights?  The movie not only showcases amazing latin dance but the struggles in the life of an average, young Cuban man during the Cuban Revolution and the process of a young, American woman fully understanding and appreciating dance.  My favorite elements about this movie were the exposures of cultural differences and elaboration of latin dancing.
As Katey learns to dance, she has to overcome the awkwardness of letting her body move freely, then do it in front of others, and then do it while a guy is touching and leading her body; something that everyone must do to learn latin dance.  Javier helps her in this while in his own personal life, he supports his family and faces the struggles of the cuban revolution with his community and his family.  I love how the movie captures both these very different struggles in two very different people but brings them together anyways.
As a Chicana who grew up in San Diego, I have experienced and observed both sides of latino and non-latino reactions to latin dancing.  I have noticed that many non-latinos or anyone who did not grow up around dance around them feel that latin dancing is a form of dirty dancing because it involves being close to your partner and ultimately freeing your body in dance.  To latinos or anyone who grew up around dance, however, latin dance is a delicacy, an art, and the way to happiness; it is everything good.  Latin dancing is one of the main ways, and my favorite besides food, that latinos get together to celebrate their culture, life, and happiness.  The difference in these views is portrayed very well in this movie through how Javier and other dancers in the movie explain latin dancing to Katey as an art compared to how Katey’s parents and others from the country club react in an appalling way towards the latin dancing.

Havana Nights
	Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was a very interesting film. It was an insightful experience to urban salsa during a very interesting time in world history. It showed us the complicated relationship between the US and Cuba and how people were often separated by race and nationality. However, it is incredibly important to note that the solution to this issue was dance. In the film, we saw our two protagonists fall in love and begin what can best be described as a romantic relationship. The two character quickly find out that all that keeps them apart ultimately does not matter due to their mutual love of music and dancing. The political message was a little out of place. Pro-Castro? No Thanks.
	I believe that this film does a lot in showing us the uniting power of music and dancing. Being a part of the salsa decal I have seen myself grow in a way that I had not before. It is important to state that I have been able to speak and bond with many people that I normally would not have. Apart from this I believe we can all agree that dancing has played an import role in culture and how people meet and interact. It is important for the healthy development of relationships in the presence of adversity. Through dance, we can hope to encourage a much more diverse world since we can have people from different backgrounds enjoy the same thing and this leads to a better world. I am thankful to have watched this film as it has changed my life and shown me the possibilities and how powerful dancing salsa is.

HOW TO: Make Good TinyURLs
Written 10.28.13 by André Crabb
It’s nice to make TinyUrls for documents in our Drive that we’d like to share with either students in the DeCal or the general public. Usually, its for the former.

Make the doc on Google Drive viewable by anyone with the link. NOT editable by anyone.
Copy the link.
Go to: http://tinyurl.com/
Paste the link in the ‘Long URL’ box.
If the doc/folder being shared is a general document (ie. Salsa Dance Locations):
Name the alias “Salsa_____” where “____” is what the doc is about.
ie. “SalsaLocations”
ie. “SalsaDeCalFinals”
Otherwise, if the doc/folder is specific to a semester (ie. DeCal Group sign-ups for Fall 2013)
Name the alias “SalsaDeCal____ ____” where “____” is what the doc is about, and the second “____” is the year & semester. This ensures succeeding semesters can follow the same format.
ie. “SalsaDeCalGroups13fall”
ie. “SalsaDeCalApplication14spring”
Add the new tiny URL to the document “Tinyurl Links” in our drive so we can keep track of it.
If possible, add a line “Viewable At: TINY_URL_HERE” in the document so anyone viewing it knows how to easily get there again.

--------------------
	I thought the movie Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, while in the end a cheesy rom-com, had an interesting take on dancing as well as was able to incorporate the society and politics of Cuba. I liked how the movie constantly incorporated dance, and that there was a bigger plot beyond a love story. I like how they filmed the movie, such that the dancing scenes were dramaticized, such as when the young couple danced in time with the parents across the old timey film drop. 
	I think it was interesting how Cuban dance was portrayed. In all circumstances, it was shown as erotic. Even in the country of Cuba itself, it was portrayed as the “other” as compared to the white American characters. This difference was especially seen when classical ballroom dancing was shown alongside Cuban salsa. I thought that was interesting because it seems that comparing two different styles of dance will always attract viewers to the differences in the styles. This movie however seemed to draw on the fact that the cuban style salsa had more hip movement and other differences that make it a more sensual dance. Even at the scene in the club, the camera angles that the director chose highlighted the hips and upper chest areas, further provoking a sensual feel and response. 
	Another thing I found interesting about the movie was how it incorporated the love story line into the dancing. From the way the movie made it appear, it seemed that the couple was struggling with making their dancing “great” until they had a romantic connection. What it seems to me from the class though is that it is totally possible for two salsa dancers to be great dancers, as long as they have chemistry (even if it is not romantic chemistry - it could just be a good amount of tension and just getting along well as leads and follows). As a whole, though, I thought the movie was a fun watch, and it was nice to be able to see the characters do the basic footwork because I was able to count along in my head and follow the steps.

Yelitza Cervantes
The movie Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is an audible and visually pleasing film that not only captures an interesting historical time period in Cuba, but highlights the beauty of dancing salsa (cuban salsa) through its beautiful cinematic effects. Throughout the whole movie I was entranced by the culturally rich scenes, the fascinating landscape, and captivating dance routines. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because of the music, the dancing, and the insight on cuban culture. The fact that one of my favorite Mexican actors starred in it - Diego Luna - made it all the more enjoyable. Nevertheless, a specific scene that stood out to me was when Javier and Katey were watching her parents dance together on tape and Javier commented something along the lines of “do you see how they dance… like they want to be in each others arms”. This scene was one of my favorites because it made me realize how much connection is formed when dancing. Dancing is more than technical footwork and body movement, it’s a feeling, a live fluid art, and it takes communal effort. It made me see dancing in a new perspective; it made me realize that when you are dancing with someone, you are sharing a part of yourself and letting yourself be guided as well as be the guide to your partner. The dancing in this movie helped me understand that the physical and intangible connection you have with someone while dancing is what ultimately allows for dancing to become a visual art. Without these intangible connections, to the music, to your partner, the passion and fun behind dancing diminishes; because dancing is much more than just rhythmic movement, it’s a form of self expression.  Through this performance lens, one can see that dancing involves much more than the memorization of a routine, and when it comes to dancing cuban salsa you need to be ready to get down and let loose.  This film made me want to travel to Cuba and to start dancing cuban style salsa!

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is a movie that provides an interesting perspective towards salsa dancing both as a culture and as an art form that relates to other dance forms. The movie portrays salsa dancing as a way for the protagonists to escape the problems they face in their normal lives. for Javier, it allows him to experience happiness during the bloody Cuban revolution, and for Katey, she is able to experience access to the real world from which her parents tried to keep her hidden. It was interesting to watch both characters grow and develop through their journey training for the salsa competition; both Javier and Katey had matured immensely through the duration of their journey, and salsa made this transition smooth and enjoyable. Symbolically, the movie’s conclusion represented the characters’ loss of innocence through their maturity, as presented by their leading the salsa club through their dancing. This was paralleled through the characters’ loss of virginity, a more depiction of losing innocence. Tied into this loss of innocence was salsa dancing, which provided the protagonists with a sense of safety and understanding through their transition into maturity.
A particularly interesting artistic direction employed by the movie was the combination of ballroom dancing with salsa. Combining the moves and styles of these dance forms created an elegant choreographic style that brought out the best in both dances. Certain aspects of dancing seemed exaggerated at certain points, as exemplified by Javier’s teaching Katey to dance salsa using ocean waves as a guide. Exaggerations notwithstanding, the combination of salsa with ballroom dancing provided an interesting and unique platform through which the characters could apply their passions.

I really liked the Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights movie, I thought it was very entertaining and it was very cool to see different styles of salsa and Latin ballroom. I enjoyed seeing Katey and Javier get better as dance partners because by the end of the movie it was obvious that she was more comfortable with Javier as a partner, and they finally had good tension and connection to be dance partners. I had never seen a style of dance like the Cuban style that Javier introduces Katey to, and I was actually kind of surprised by how much she seemed to enjoy watching it in La Rosa Negra. That seemed a little out of character because Katey usually is prim and proper, but that Cuban dancing really brought out her wild side. I don’t think I would have been able to do those dance moves with someone, unless it was someone I knew really well because I am pretty shy, and that dance style had some very intimate moves. Watching them practice, and dance at the competition was also very fun. I hope that I can learn some of those dance moves because I think they did a really good choreography, I really enjoyed all of the dips. I definitely saw some of the moves we have learned in class, like the cross-body lead, in their routine. Katey and Javier seemed to be the only people on the dance floor that moved across the space given, which I think made their routine better than other couples. They also mixed the Cuban dance style with the Ballroom style and I think that this made their routine even better, because it gave them more of a connection, made them seem to have more chemistry, and just made it look like they were having more fun. I think the movie taught me how fluid salsa can be, they have so many different positions to hold each other, and then there are some moves where they are not connected at all, but both are side by side and in sync. I liked the variety in their dancing, though I would probably not do all of those moves in front of my parents—so I think Katey is very brave. Ultimately, the salsa dance that is highlighted in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights represents the power of salsa as a gateway to self-expression, exploration, and freedom through movement and bravery, as displayed by the characters in the movie. I hope to find this bravery by exploring Salsa as well.

	In Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Katey Miller must completely immerse herself into Cuban culture to learn how to dance salsa. Arriving in Cuba, she is sheltered by her parents, the American elite from everything unknown to them, even though they are foreigner’s occupying Cuba’s land. However, Katey cannot seem to separate herself from Cuba like her rich counterparts easily seem to do as they dehumanize the Cuban people. She may not know anything about Cuba, but what she can grasp is dancing. Through salsa, she is able to recognize and let go of the fear preventing her from letting the unknown, Cuba, a boy into her heart. 
	Dancing is a cross-cultural sport that makes room for communication, understanding and ultimately leads to the formation of relationships. To demonstrate this, the movie has a rich, privileged American fall in love with a poor Cuban boy whose job is to serve her. The plot of an unlikely, forbidden romance is an overdone theme in Hollywood movies. In this genre of romance movies, the only aspect that ever changes is the vehicle for the romance, which in this movie is salsa. Hollywood is able use salsa to physically show the growth of the relationship between Katey and Javier. To improve their fluidity between moves, their dancing, their relationship, cannot solely rely on technique and practice. They must instead inspect the intersectionality of dance, of Javier. Katey must learn how to move with the waves of the Cuban ocean and  understand the revolution that has shaped Javier’s entire life. As an American, her relationship with Cuba is dynamic, so her dancing must reflect that. 
	In the end, Katey and Javier learn how dance, and trust in each other but Katey is still an American and Javier is still Cuban. Katey must go to college in the United States while Javier must witness the results of the Cuban revolution.

	Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was an incredibly fun movie to watch.  First of all, I’d never heard of it beforehand, and seeing Diego Luna so young was really entertaining.  Also, I do find myself listening to salsa or other Latin music quite regularly, but I rarely get to hear and see it on screen.  This piqued my interest and has made me want to watch more movies like Havana Nights in the future.
The movie also felt relatable in some ways.  As I’m not super informed on the history and politics of Cuba, I can’t speak to the accuracy of the film in that regard.  However, I found many of Katey’s experiences relatable and accurate in comparison to things that I’ve felt.  For example, I’ve definitely stood in front of a mirror trying to figure out body isolations and just been moving around so awkwardly I’d have been mortified had anyone walked in.  Also, in the year since I started going to Open Práctica, I’ve barely begun getting comfortable with dancing intimately with someone in such close proximity.  The montage where Javier and Katey were rehearsing and she’d slap him or back away when he touched her chest really reminded me of myself when leads signal to body roll or dip me.  I’m still working on going with it instead of stiffening up.
It’s hard to explain, but I also related to Katey’s experience in that salsa for me is unlike any type of dance or activity I’ve ever been involved in, so it brings me not just out of my comfort zone, but almost immerses me in a different world, and a whole new culture.
Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie.  Though so many of the scenes were cringe-worthy or generally cheesy, the music cinematography were great and it was fun to be watching it surrounded by salsa dancers of many levels, and I could tell that my classmates found aspects of it relatable as well.

To be completely honest, I’m an original Dirty Dancing fan, and typically am not in favor of movie remakes. That said, the type of dancing in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was way more interesting to watch, especially considering we’ve been practicing salsa for a few weeks now. Despite there being complex moves I haven’t learned how to do in every dance, I could still watch their feet always using the basic step, which seems to be all you really need at the end of the day! 
I also appreciated Patrick Swayze having a part in the movie to rep the original, and while I may be a remake snob, I can definitely still enjoy a cheesy dance movie. The script may have been really superficial at times but I enjoyed the scenes at night clubs where everyone was just feeling the music and dancing with one another. In addition, I liked that, in the end, the main characters decided to stay with their families; it was good Katey wasn’t giving up a college education and that Javier was staying to finish the revolution his father had been working towards – and left it open ended for a possible spicy reunion. ;)
I think both lifestyles in the movie were exaggerated; Katey’s rich, country club family wasn’t representative of all affluent families, and Javier’s culture as a local Cuban was exaggerated as well. At the same time, the exaggerations were based on some true cultural differences, which I thought were brought together in an interesting way. They brought up some questions involving class, race, and gender which are still present today. 
Last but not least, the scene where Javier taught Katey to dance with the flow of the waves was by far the most cheesy part of the entire movie, but hey, maybe the DeCal should take a field trip. You never know if we may find ourselves amongst the flow of the waves. (lol)

Juan Alba
Racial Division in Salsa
	In director Guy Ferland’s film, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, a young American girl named Katey moves with her family to Havana, Cuba, for her father’s work. During a date with another American boy at a nearby Cuban club, she meets Javier, a local hotel worker, who dances Salsa with her for the rest of the night. When Katey dances with Javier, she becomes inspired by how other Cuban women feel and dance to the music. Katey’s admiration for Cuban Salsa is buffered by a random man who dances Salsa in the resort she lives in, who proposes her to sign up for a Salsa competition. Despite having trouble getting Javier to jump on board to be her partner for the competition, Katey ultimately convinces him to start training. 
	During her training, Katey learns about her true identity through Salsa dancing. Due to the great racial and cultural differences between Javier and her, Katey often feels afraid to be seen with him. However, when they both merge to dance, they forget about these cultural differences and become one with the music. Ferland’s depiction of Katey’s fears reveals the racial division in Havana during this time. In one side, the wealthy Americans who live in the resorts are more drawn to ballroom dancing. In the other side, the humble Cubans dance the night away hot and crowded Salsa clubs. Despite coming from different socio-economic backgrounds, Katey and Javier both learn from each other’s dances to improve their performance. The way the film associates rich white people to ballroom dancing and poor cubans to Salsa dancing reveals the importance of these styles of dance in the cultural identity of these people. Though Katey is forced to leave Javier at the end of the movie, they both learn that in order to improve a dance, they must be open-minded to change.

Like any dancing movie, really, this movie was very cheesy, but I did love the displays of dancing throughout! I wish there were more dancing scenes outside of the main characters’ own experiences. The salsa dancing in this movie was different than types I had seen before, more intimate and sensual than I have been exposed to. I think I have seen more professional forms of Salsa, like in the competition, than club salsa dancing. Seeing how the people who danced moved so freely made me realize that I need more movement and I need to release my own tension. Being rigid or stiff may help in other forms of dance, but if you want to flow and move in order to “feel the music”, you have to let loose and relax. I also wish that they had used more well-known salsa music or used more Latinx music instead of the Black Eyed Peas and Christina Aguilera. I believe there would have been more cultural appreciation if the movie used more culturally relevant music. Also, it seems as if there was an attempt to shed light on the Cuban Revolution, but it did so in ways that were irrelevant to the plot, and that were oddly placed, making very loosely based connections. If they really wanted to have some sort of plot connection, I think there should have been more attention paid to what was going on around them and how music and dancing played a part in the revolution or the resistance. Overall, I believe that this movie was pretty bad, but the dancing is what saved it. It was beautiful to see that they mixed different types of dancing into this movie; the more formal kind that the main character’s parents danced, the casual dancing on the street, competition dancing, and club dancing. It represents different faces and facets of dance, not reducing it to just one “correct” or “main” type. Dancing comes in all forms, and can be translated into others as well.

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights Write-Up
I found “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” to be a classic example of a member movie gone wrong, in that the story and acting came across as boring and uninteresting. The characters, aside from Diego Luna, played uninspiring figures in progressing the story and were not helped by their cliché dialogue. I also was lost on the entire purpose of the movie when by the end Luna decided to forget about the cash prize at the competition and instead place full confidence in the revolution. This plot point seemed to trivialize the entire point of the film and left a sense of distaste in my mouth. I also didn’t like the revolutions role in the film and the two romances the main actress gets involved in, it only seemed out of place and a desperate attempt at creating an emotional connection with the audience when there was none to be had.  The cash grab that this movie represented was also fully aware in its purpose when Patrick Swayze makes a cameo appearance that feels extremely out of place, especially considering the previous film. The dancing however was fun to watch and made me want to improve my own dancing style. So overall, I can say that the film accomplished the reason it was shown: to inspire us to become better dancers. If a white book smart girl from the United States could literally beat out professional dancers, who’s to say I can’t aspire to such heights? 
	Would I watch this film again? Probably not. It represents a highly fictionalized and Hollywood-esque take on the Cuban revolution and salsa in general. For this reason, I could only ever see this film as a made for tv flick, wherein you have the talents of a fantastic actor – Diego Luna – go to waste after his amazing role in Y Tu Mama Tambien. I would go so far as to ask whether Patrick Swayze has ever seen the film.

	I enjoyed watching Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights very much over the past two weeks in our DeCal class. It was very interesting to get to know a different Salsa culture, that is, the dirty dancing in Cuba. The way the plot was devised was helpful for viewers like us, because most of us were as new to the Cuban culture as the Americans in the film were, from the language barrier, to the cultural ignorance, and especially the dancing. I can imagine having the same reaction as Katey when she had just arrived at the - being totally put off by the openness of the dancing in La Rosa Negra. 
	The plot development was exaggerated in my opinion. In real life, it is unfortunately rarely the case that people of such distant social classes, that of Katey and Javier, have so much opportunity to interact, and have enough in common to fall in love with each other. Nonetheless, I do think the development of their romantic interactions is magnified and expedited for good reasons. It is a movie after all, so I do not expect them to put in an everyday-life type of storyline. 
	My favorite part would definitely be the first round of the Latin ballroom contest, where Javier and Katey danced beautifully, and fearlessly in front of all the more professional dancers, and most importantly, Katey’s parents’ disapproval. It was absolutely great to see her parents understand, or rather, give in, to allowing Katey pursue her love, though that is also a less realistic aspect since most parents would probably do everything to stop this from happening. 
	Another aspect I enjoyed was Javier’s character. He is not the average Cuban boy with great dancing skills. His patience and guidance for Katey was so valuable in the relationship, and really made the romance between the two possible.

Dirty Dancing Havana Nights 
Paper# 1
Reflection on Dirty Dancing Havana Nights
	The ability to defy expectations and barriers is a quality that the two protagonists embodied in the move Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. Their mutual love for music and for one another manifested in powerful statements against the divisions that ruled their lives. It was interesting to watch how Katey and Javier were able to bring both of their cultural backgrounds and create something new and unique. I related to Katey and her desire to interact with people from different backgrounds and break free of the constraints placed on her by family. I enjoyed watching her strength in standing up to those that got in her way. It was inspiring to see that those around Katey and Javier who initially opposed their relationship, in the end supported their dedication to dance and their love for one another. Their bond through music was moving and moved those around them in unexpected ways. I enjoyed watching the transformation of Katey’s sister, who was initially opposed, but then after understanding Katey’s love for Javier was truly invested in their flourishing. Specifically, with regard to the dancing, their footwork was impressive. Their mix of the two dances was unique. I hope to be able to dance like Katey after taking the intermediate DeCal. The dresses that Katey wore were vibrant and really accentuated the dances. Overall, the entire incorporation of the differences in music, politics, backgrounds, love, and dancing lead to perfect barrier defying dances between Javier and Katey. While I assume the ending was more realistic this way, I was pleased that that the two didn’t end up being together.

	“Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” was quite entertaining, although it was exceedingly cheesy at times. But I don’t think it being cheesy detracts from the positive aspects of the movie. The positive aspects being that it is a fun, upbeat movie that shows off some pretty sweet dancing. That being said, I don’t really think the plot of the movie, in regards to dancing, runs much deeper than this.
	The movie did not portray dancing as a significant part of the revolution going on simultaneously with the timeline of the events in the movie. It showed certainly that dancing is an integral part of the culture, but the movie did not seem to expand on that idea much and, instead, focused on the drama between the two main characters and the their relationship leading up to the competition. In this way, it was difficult to much relate to either of the main characters in particular, because the movie does not really draw the viewer in to any internal conflict within either of the characters. The most I could relate to either of them is that I really love dancing, which is also what made the movie enjoyable, despite its cheesiness. But since the main connection the movie invoked was one relatively straight forward as enjoying dancing, and enjoying that dancing was the medium that the story progressed through, it did not impart any real significant or deep meaning as I watched it. But again, a movie does not necessarily need to do this in order to be enjoyable.
	As a final comment, I think most of the drama within the movie was exaggerated, but I could believe the rest of the movie was relatively accurate. I have not had any experience in Cuban nightclubs, but I imagine that there are nightclubs that resemble the one in the movie quite closely. And I could also believe that the gap between the types of people living there, wealthy Americans and less wealthy locals, is also relatively accurate.

	This semester I've only been able to attend one of the Gio’s events in addition to Open Practica and a workshop. The Gio’s event in September was my first experience dancing socially outside of Thursday OP. I’m glad I had the opportunity to experience one of the Salsa at Cal events, it was amazingly packed and there was a great variety of dancers as well as many familiar faces. Clearly, social dancing this way is one of the fastest ways to see quick dance skill improvement - I felt improved after just the one event, because I was pushed to dance with people of higher skill levels so I learned some new patterns!
	The workshop was a bachata intensive workshop with Kathy Reyes. This has to be one of my favorite experiences in dance so far! Kathy was full of passion and energy to teach us, which made it so fun and a great experience overall. The most difficult part of this workshop was the footwork segment. Besides being hard to see her footsteps with so many other people in the room, the song we did the steps to was pretty quick. I don't remember too much from this part because choreography is difficult for me to learn in such a short amount of time, but it was still memorable. My favorite thing we learned was musicality. We learned through a specific song how during an intro we can stylistically move through the music. This was so helpful to learn a new repertoire of simple moves that look cool and keep the beginning interesting. I hope to continue working on musicality skills and improve them. 
	Another great part to the workshop was partnering. This gave both leads and follows to switch roles and try both parts in the interest of learning what it is like to both lead and be led into a turn and the proper tension and grip to have. Traditional leads got to feel what it’s like to be turned forcefully, and how nice it is to be turned gently. This reminded me of how I want to learn to lead salsa and bachata.

	It was my first time attending a latin social dance event, the event was not as exciting as I thought it would be because my friend and I were both beginners. Nevertheless, With more practice, we will be able to enjoy dancing at a social dance event much more in future events.  On the bright side, I had a pretty good time with my friend, we pregamed at my place and then walked together to Gio’s together. Furthermore, I was able to see my other friends from Salsa outside of class and that was pretty fun since I enjoy socializing with other people as much as I enjoy dancing.. A few of my friends is taking this class because they want to connect better with their culture, my other friends are taking this class because they just want to meet new people and destress from their hectic life at Berkeley, and then there is me, I am taking this class for many reasons. Most of my friend are Hispanic so I thought it would be nice for me to connect with their culture and at the same having to opportunity to destress and meet new people.

My friend and I were dancing to a song and she told me this song is very popular from where she is from. I suddenly started thinking about my homeland and how when I listen to the songs from there, it generates a certain feeling of sadness that is really hard to describe and it is definitely not nostalgia. Suddenly, I feel disconnected from her culture as much as I am connected to mine. I think I might have to learn Spanish if I want to connect with the Hispanic culture  on a more profound level.

I went to the first Gio’s Pizza and Bocce Salsa Event and I found it nervewracking! I found it nervewracking because the social dancing norms differed with the DeCal’s in-class norms and I was nervous about how well I would be able to follow outside of the classroom setting.
	During the DeCal, we rotate partners every few minutes and generally follow the choreography of our instructors. I was nervous when I went social dancing because I realized finding a dance party was not as seamless and easy in social settings as it is in the classroom. In social settings, I or a lead must build the courage to ask for a dance partner. I found myself looking around for familiar faces, so I would not feel too out of my comfort zone, have a higher likelihood of someone saying yes, and reduce my chances of embarrassment or rejection. I asked a few people to dance and a few people asked me to dance. I don’t know if this comes down to my personality or the interactive dynamic between dance partners, but the idea of being asked or asking someone else to dance made me feel a larger need to be the perfect dancer so they would not be disappointed by my dancing skills, regret asking me or accepting my proposal, and embarrassed for me.
	Since I attended a social dancing event at the beginning of the semester, I did not know many moves, and I was very aware of that. I tried to keep up with partners who knew more moves than me, but felt embarrassed whenever I messed up on my attempts of new moves and even on the simple moves! However, I found that it was important to find a partner I felt comfortable with. I danced later with a friend who knew I was still learning. He encouraged me while dancing, saying I did specific moves nicely, which made me feel more confident and have a more pleasant dancing experience.

	Dirty Dancing : Havana Nights was a film that attempted to demonstrate differences in cultures through dance and it chose to do so by setting the film in a n interesting point in time during Cuban history. I think this film had good intentions and it was a little admirable to see them not ignore the hard times that the citizens of Cuba went through during their revolution. However, admirable I thought it was I think they did a huge disservice to the hardships that many of the in the Cuban civilian population went through during the authoritarian dictatorship largely backed and facilitated by the Unites States government. I think that the directors wish of having an extra layer of complexity to the movie ruined its artistic value. 
	I think what this film did do well is highlight the passion behind that Cubans and a lot of Latino/Hispanics put into music and dancing. It’s a way to express themselves and infuse a beautiful and specific flare from respective cultures infuse into their dance movements. I liked the visible connection the two main protagonists had in the film. Their clothing during dancing scenes was an interesting to observe throughout the film.  It seemed to accentuate their dance moves well and another dimension to their dancing.  I think I was able to appreciate the dancing scenes more after taking this dancing class. I tried to focus on their transitions, foot movements, body posture and overall technique with a much more critical eye. I was able to be more cognoscente about how difficult it is to make all the dance sequences look so effortless. 
I think one of the biggest things I tool from the dancing aspect was the trust the protagonists had to have in each other. Once they developed that trust with each other they were able to showcase their individual skills and their passion was almost tangible on screen and we see how they both learned from each other and grew as dancers. Over all the film was decent and their cheesy lines were hilarious and kept me entertained throughout.

DAVID NAVARRO
I loved the movie Dirty Dancing – Havana Nights. Coming from Peru, music makes me feel more connected to my Latin culture. There were some aspects of the movie that I really liked.

First, we could see how salsa music is so engrained in Latin American culture. The scene when Katey finds Javier dancing in the park reminded me of the parks of Lima, where you find people all the weekends dancing salsa, merengue, etc. People get together and practice dancing and teach others who want to join. 

Other aspect that I liked was to see some Cubans singing when they dance. This is something that is a lot more common and was not completely reflected in the movie. Most of Latin Americans sing all the songs, as they are part of their culture. In my opinion, it is difficult to be really passionate about salsa or bachata and not to know the lyrics of some songs.
Another funny part was to see how the relationship between Katey and Javier evolves as both have a common passion for dancing. This happens in reality and partners sometimes become a couple.

On the other hand, I think the movie exaggerated how people touch their partners when they dance, especially in the first scene at La Rosa Negra. I have been in many salsa clubs in Latin America, and it is true that Latin rhythms are very corporal and partners have high level of contact. However, the movie emphasized that too much to a level that does not reflect reality.

Overall, it was a funny experience and I could say the movie reminded me some reasons of why I love dancing salsa.

In September I attended a club event at Gio’s Pizza that a latinx org was having. It was a really fun experience and it was not like dancing at the DeCal. At the event there was a lot of different type of music such as hip hop, reggaeton, cumbia, banda, salsa, and bachata. I had gone to club events before but for the salsa and bachata songs I had danced with friends and not with a partner. When a bachata song came on someone asked me to dance and I had a chance to apply some of the things I had learned during class and office hours. Although I did not know many moves I was able to last the whole song and it did not feel too repetitive, I even learned some new moves. It felt nice dancing in a social setting outside of the class because I did not know what to expect. The people that I danced with had different levels of experience, most were more experienced than me so I was a bit nervous about dancing with them because I only knew a few steps and turns but it was really fun.
One thing that I learned during social dancing is the importance of tension. During class I know what to expect because we follow a routine but when I was dancing outside of class I did not know the next step the lead was going to do. I had to pay attention to the tension in my arms to know what the next move was going to be. This is something I want to continue improving on because sometimes when the lead makes a cue I do not read it correctly and end up doing a turn instead of a hair comb. 
Social dancing has made me more excited to learn salsa and bachata, even though I still have a lot more to learn I’m so ready to continue improving. I need to continue to go to  more social dancing events and not just rely on open practica and office hours, although those are very helpful.

Salsa Essay 2: Sanya Sehgal
	I attended a Salsa event at Gio’s that the salsa club held back in September. It was very interesting to go social dancing, I had never been social dancing before. I thought it was pretty cool to be able to use the skills I had learned in class. I was pretty nervous that I was going to have a hard time following with people I had never danced with before, but it was more or less fine for the most part. I danced with about four people, and I think I was able to follow pretty well. Most of the people I danced with were also somewhat beginners, so it wasn’t too difficult, because I was somewhat familiar with all of the moves they tried. I did dance with one person who was at a higher level, and that was pretty cool because I learned some new things and got to see how well I could follow when I don’t know the moves as well. 
I brought a friend along as well and the two of us came for the lesson beforehand, which was also really nice because we both got to get into dancing salsa with new partners, before the social dancing began. My dance partner for the lesson was also a beginner so we learned together, and then when the social dancing began, we danced together as well. I think it went pretty well, but I would like to dance with more experienced dancers as well in the future because that seems like it would be a fun experience.   I am excited to learn more salsa and, in the future, go to more salsa social events because I had fun for a while. I was even able to work up the courage to ask a few people to dance. 
I learned a lot from that social dancing experience and I think it was good because now I understand the dancing more intuitively, as opposed to knowing what each move is going to be, I am able to feel the tension and pay attention to body language and predict and follow what the lead is about to do.

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was a movie I could see myself watching at a middle school sleepover. When Patrick Swayze was plopped into the plot, I couldn’t help but gush as I had as a teen with my pre-teen friend group years ago. And Javier? God, he was on par with Chad Michael Murray. A-dork-able. And what teenage girl doesn’t love a good love story? And subsequently, a little hope for her own future…
I saw a lot of myself in Katey at the beginning of the movie: well-meaning, shy, and overly academic. That scene where she almost turned down the party because of homework was super relatable. This part of her character was super developed in the beginning of the movie, but she kinda lost it toward the end. The movie didn’t portray any sort of tension as she transitioned away from her nerdy-self to her new form as a  young-and-sweet-only-17 dancing queen. I just don’t think that transition would have been so easy in practice, or so fast.
I was also surprised with how quickly Katey’s parents came to terms with her relationship with Javier. I see this sort of forgiveness/ reconciliation all the time in movies, and it’s super hopeful but… exaggerated and unrealistic I think. I mean, good for her? I just cannot see this happening so quickly (or for that matter at all) in my own family. 
I really like how Javier’s dancing was less structured and more about “feeling” it – or at least this is what he expressed about his own dancing. Of course a proper framework is great for dancing, but I feel like I’ve been super caught up in the framework so far in the class. I’m hoping to loosen up a little and find my own groove in the coming weeks. I got a good start on that goal at office hours after we watched the movie, and am getting excited about putting in time in the future to “feel” and to develop my own distinct style.

	“Dancing is about being exactly who you want to be in that moment” – Katey Miller. I’m not sure if I have a favorite part in the movie since I was fully entertain from beginning to end but I definitely have a favorite quote. When Katey mentioned how little by little she was becoming exactly who she wanted to be I started to identify with the message the movie was trying to get across. It’s not just about dancing, or winning a contest, the message I got out of this whole story was about the process of becoming the person you truly are rather than the person everyone wants you to be. It’s corny I know but it’s relatable. The way Katey felt when she moved to Cuba was the same way I felt when I came to UC Berkeley. She minded her own business, alone and always working in order to make her parents and teachers proud. Now there’s nothing wrong with any of that but in the process it seemed that Katie forgot to consider what she really wanted for herself and what made her happy in the end. From freshman year till junior year every decision I made had to pass one simple question, “Is what I’m about to do getting me closer to my career goal?” Unfortunately most fun things that involve socializing and spending quality time with the people I cared about would not pass that question. Although it wasn’t part of the movie I feel like the character of Katey would have a similar mentality with regards as to how she went about her day. However, as she started dancing and started living more in the moment than in her own head she started to become more in tune with the person she wanted to become. Being the worst dancer everywhere you go was another thing I immediately related to but I’m glad Katie push through that discomfort in the movie and I hope I can do the same thing in order to learn not just how to dance but how to be present and live in the moment.

	The film Dirty Dancing Havana Nights was fun to watch especially when there were dance scenes. The energy and choreography put into the dance sequences was motivational to watch and full of impressive moves, some that I’m familiar with and many I’ve never seen before. I enjoy watching more advanced dancers as it helps me begin to understand where the beats are in a song and see different ways to move along with the music. The transition of Katey’s dancing as she goes from her more controlled ballroom style training to learning to embrace her body’s movements and dancing with Javier as she loosens up and finds passion in her dancing. The music in the film was also great to listen to while watching the dancers. Watching them move to the rhythm of a song was great. I payed special attention tot he costumes worn when competing and what was worn for just going out to the club. The gowns worn for competition were especially beautiful and flow with the moves so they look cool while moving about. I’m always looking at the different types of dancing shoes people dance in to get a feel of what heels and shoes are appropriate for dancing out.
Overall as a film, the storyline seemed a bit cheesy and predictable but also very funny and cute. I liked the film even better now watching it for a second time and I got to watch the whole story this time rating than just skipping through to the dace scenes which allowed me to better
understand the circumstance there in Cuba the the characters were facing. I haven’t watched the original fully and the important dance scenes we watched in class were very good and make me want to learn more and keep practicing even though learning to dance is awkward at times, but it’s so much fun and I hope to gain and improve my dancing skills a lot!

	What I liked about the movie accurately portrayed the racism era it was set in. When Javier and Katey take the dance for at the Christmas Ball, the look of disgust on all the old white people’s faces seemed to reflect the sentiment of the time. I was pretty funny to see the looks on their faces as that is something we really don’t think about now a days. Several times throughout the movie, the line “He’s not one of us,” was used  to try to dissuade Katey from continuing her relationship. I like that at the end of the movie, the mother who got to the point of slapping  Katey for her actions was eventually supportive of what she was doing and even suggested a move to make their final dance more impressive. I really didn’t like James as a character as he was a douche. I don’t like how nothing ever really happened to him after he assaulted Katey because she was too afraid to speak up about it to her mom, and instead the person walking her home and keeping her safe after the event go screwed over by the event. I think my favorite part of the movie was Javier’s transition from being just a street/club dancer to a more formal dancer that still largely kept his style. What I really did not like about the movie was the fact that they do the same dance for both parties. Nothing really changes in their choreography from the 1st dance to the 2nd except for adding in the turn her mother suggests. That just seems lazy and uncreative. They could have at least changed up more for their routine, but nothing was really done or shown in the movie in the week between the dances. I liked the street dancing that they showed when Katey is walking home. It seems like a lot of fun to be in public and dancing with people of all ages and just generally having a great time with the people of your community. My favorite part of the movie was that they kept Patrick Swayze as the random dance instructor that is hired for the country club. Even though he isn’t a big character in the movie, his character has continuity between the 2 Dirty Dancing movies.

	The last time I went out dancing was this Saturday at Pura Nightclub in San Francisco. It was my first time going and it was amazing to see the four different dance floors all blasting different genres of latin music. If my friends and I were in the mood for reggaeton we would go to the main room or if we wanted to dance bachata we would just switch over to a different room. What was different was definitely the culture, which of course is to be expected because it’s a club. In the decal or open práctica the objective is to learn how to dance and everyone is really focused on learning the moves and collaborating with their partner. In the club setting it was interesting because on the night I was there it seemed the vast majority of people were not partner dancing (it might have been just because it was extremely crowded). It mostly consisted of groups of friends all getting down in dance circles, which was fun too. However, I was really looking forward to practice partner dancing salsa and bachata, it was still a really good time dancing with friends though. We practiced the liquid lead technique and would switch off leading. I did dance with a person that was not in my friend group who did not know how to dance salsa or bachata so it was a really good learning experience trying to be the lead and guide him through some dance moves. I think through that experience I’ve developed more of an understanding for the lead’s role and in turn how I can improve as a follow in really keeping engaged with my lead to not stumble by missing a signal. Overall, it was a great experience and I look forward to going back and putting to use the moves I’ve learned in class.

	I went to one of the Gio’s salsa nights and it was a lot of fun! I didn’t have many expectations going into the event. My main experience with social dancing comes from going to swing dance events. There, it’s all about dancing and the music. There’s a huge dance floor, and that’s it. Gio’s was a mix of a social dance scene and a bar, which I found...interesting. I think I would have preferred if it had been focused only on dancing. The “main” area was rather crowded with people that were standing and talking with their friends. I thought this was fine, but just not what I was looking for.
	One thing that struck me was how much bachata was played! I thought it would be at least half salsa and half bachata, but it felt like 4 out of 5 songs were salsa. At first I was a bit disappointed, but seeing great bachata dancers inspired me to learn more bachata. By the end of the night, I found that I was having quite a bit of fun dancing both. It also motivated me to attend Kathy Reyes’ bachata workshop, which I found very useful!
	Compared to the DeCal, it was a rather different experience. In the DeCal, I feel much more comfortable messing up, pausing, counting out loud, and doing other beginner-level moves. I felt much more pressure to “be a good lead.” Overall, the followers at the social event were also very good. I noticed that because they followers do not know what the next move will be, there is no way for them to back-lead of anticipate what you will do. I think this practice was good for me as a lead. For example, I realized that there were a few moves like the running man that I just would not do a good job of leading. I hadn’t noticed this before since the followers in the DeCal would usually correct for any bad leading. I also realized that there are some salsa song where I definitely struggle to find the “one” (and not confusing it with the “five”).
	Another interesting difference that I noticed was the floor. I always thought only advanced dancers would appreciate the difference between different floors, but I noticed that the floor was a bit more sticky than the dance floors in the DeCal. This wasn’t a big issue, but it made some turns a bit more difficult.

	I have been going to Ashkenaz every month since I moved to Berkeley. So far, Ashkenaz has been my favorite monthly dance event. I really enjoy the crowd there and meeting new people. I like that it is mostly bachata dancing, my favorite dance style, and I also like that they play some  salsa songs, which helps me improve my salsa dancing skills. I did my first birthday dance in September at Ashkenaz, which was super fun. I loved dancing with different people during one song and quickly switching between the leads. At first, it was a little bit overwhelming to quickly switch dancing with partners, especially because each dancer had a different dancing style which I had to match, but I enjoyed it a lot after getting a minute to adjust. 
What I like the most about social dancing is that I get to dance with individuals that have different dancing skills. I enjoy dancing with my classmates at the DeCal, where we get to practice together; However, social dancing allows me to learn faster as I dance with people with different dancing experiences and at different levels. Although dance classes are critical, I realized over time that I learn much faster while social dancing as I solidify the steps I learned in class and expand on the moves and the styling. Even when I get busy and I do not have the time to go social dancing, I force myself to go every other week  in order to improve my dancing skills and keep remembering the steps I learned in class. 
While I was at Ashkenaz, I noticed a lot of people using the dance moves that we learned in class. A few leaders that I have danced with have also used some of the moves that we learned at the DeCal and I was able to follow them; it was good to practice those moves outside of class. Things that were taught in lecture applied as well. The dance etiquette lecture was important in my opinion, as well as the lecture when we learned about the instruments used in Latin music.

Aside from the open practica’s held on Thursdays I was able to attend “Salsa on Sproul” on October 12th.  I enjoyed this event very much and just like past social dances such as Gio’s my experience was great!  I always enjoy going to these events because it gives me a chance to practice my salsa/bachata skills, meet new people and learn fun combos. With that being said, my favorite part about these social dances is when I get to dance with random people; I know that for some this may be very intimidating but I enjoy it since it gives me an opportunity to learn different dancing techniques and styles. As a person who loves to dance, I never go to events having any expectations except to have fun and dance the night away with my friends. Ever since I was little I loved to dance to anything from bachata to corridos to merengue or cumbia, but now being away from home and attending a predominantly caucasian institution I have not gotten many opportunities to dance to my latin music I grew up listening to. Which is why Salsa at Cal caught my attention ever since my first semester here at Cal, I loved how there were so many other people who shared a passion for latin music like me. The events Salsa at Cal puts on such as the ones I have attended on sproul, at Gio’s and others remind me a little of home. At these events I have danced with international exchange students from latin america, with friends, with older men and women who have all been super friendly. As someone who always follows there have instances where I dance with someone who knows way more moves than me and after a few missed turns and late cues I finally learn a new spin I can add to my repertoire. Because of open practica’s, the salsa decal and these social events I have noticed that my dancing has gotten a lot better and my confidence has grown, and as a result I have become more comfortable dancing in front of people and with strangers.

	I’ve been to a couple events outside of the decal but my favorite so far has been Salsa on Sproul. It was so much fun to connect and dance with people I knew from the decal as well as people I met at the event. Some of the people I met on Sproul I see every now and then at other events like Gio’s and Ashkenaz. 
	Honestly, dancing outside of class is incredibly freeing because there is less pressure to do the move correctly and more emphasis on just dancing and feeling the music. Regardless of whether you are dancing with an experienced partner or someone who just learned, your goal is not to perform a complex sequence of steps but just to enjoy yourself. Mistakes are expected and passed over when they happen. It’s also interesting to dance with different people who all have slightly varied styles and techniques. I think that adapting to a new way of dancing with every partner did a lot to improve my responsiveness. 
	At the same time, I really appreciate the drilling that we did in class because it has made salsa feel much more natural. Now I know (generally) how someone signals a turn and how the right amount of tension can make you more responsive to your partner. 
	I definitely liked dancing in a non class setting far more because it let me really let go and enjoy salsa as social activity and I can’t wait to go to more events.

There’s a lot of differences between class and Ashkenaz. There’s definitely more than listed here, but there’s not a lot I can fit on one page so here are the most relevant points to my experience.
The main difference is that it’s a lot harder to pick out the beat. There are people talking and clamoring and looking for their friends and you’re standing there confused and unable to really hear the beat. Because you’re unable to hear the beat you’re relying on your partner. Sometimes your partner has a hard time hearing over the music too and therefore you’re both struggling. While I was at Ashkenaz, I had no difficulty hearing the music and beat. I could not say the same for my partners. I danced with a lot of people and I realized how difficult it must be for people to pick it up on the fly.
The second, and less important, difference is that your partner often has no idea what to do with you when the only thing you can do reliably is your basic or the only thing they can do is the basic. Anything else is just asking to be stepped on. I would argue that this particular situation is because most of the people I danced with were just learning how to dance bachata which means we were all suffering together as Kathy Reyes tried to form us into decent dancers. This brings us to my last point.
Kathy Reyes is a powerful and terrifying being. She’s an amazing dancer and an amazing instructor, but also completely and utterly terrifying in her perpetual optimism and belief that you too can excel at dancing. I’m not an amazing dancer and being in the same room as her was a difficult experience because I had a hard time keeping up. It was also an amazing experience because I grew a lot very quickly. No losses.

I went to a dance club called 3 Vinos when I went back home to Southern California. It is a restaurant/entertainment bar that has themed events several days a week. I went on, a Saturday, and they had a Cumbia and Salsa event. This was the first time I had gone to a club or dancing event specifically themed for this type of music. It was very different than dancing in the DeCal. This was especially because I felt very intimidated by the amount of people there who seemed very good at dancing, and it all looked so natural. Everyone was well dressed, the music was great, the amount of people there was immense! It definitely exceeded my expectations as to how fancy but ambiently welcoming the event was. I went with family, so I didn’t feel extremely intimidated as most of the time I was just dancing within my own group, but seeing how others randomly came up to ask one of my family members to dance was interesting to see, yet made me a little uncomfortable. It is nice to dance with others outside of your own group because they may have a different style, but at the same time it is intimidating if you are not at the level that they are, and it may be embarrassing! I danced pretty basic moves, did turns, none of the combos we have learned in class so far, I used. I really had to tune into my senses and cues, something we have been talking about, to get a feel to where my lead is trying to take me. I had to really feel that tension and pay attention to what was next, but at the same time, go with the flow which I found to be quite difficult. We have the ability to mess up and try again in the DeCal, but in these clubs, you just go on to the next move and try not to mess up again which is a bit stressful but an experience nonetheless. t was an exhilarating experience, I hope to go to another event like this again, but hopefully with much more practice, confidence, and material that I can showcase!

	In September, I went to a Salsa at Cal event at Gio’s. I went after work and thought I would feel too tired to dance for very long, but I actually had a great time. I met up with some friends I had from beginner salsa which made the night more comfortable because if I wasn’t dancing with anyone, I had other people to hang out with or to dance together in a group. I really liked the music and enjoyed going because I had a basic foundation from the beginner level class last semester. Even though it’s always intimidating to ask someone to dance, it felt more natural to ask partners to dance with me since I felt like I had enough experience to be an acceptable dance partner. I really enjoyed the music because there was a variety, thus allowing us all to practice both bachata and salsa. The DJ even threw in some meringue for fun, which seemed to excite a lot of people. I didn’t know how to do it so I just tried to watch everyone else to see what the moves were supposed to look like. I liked that most of the partners I had were very respectful of space and allowed me to distance myself a bit if I felt the need. All the salseros at the events are so talented, and even though I had the basics down for both bachata and salsa, I felt slightly overwhelmed as I tried to remember the steps and be the best partner I possibly could. I wholeheartedly believe that dancing with people who are better than you are will make you into a much better and more versatile dancer. 
	I have been having a very busy semester, so I haven’t been able to make it out to any other socials, but I remember from last semester that Bachata Nights at Ashkenaz on the first Thursday of every month were by far the most fun and the best socials that Salsa at Cal does. Everyone dances so freely and is so excited to be there for solely bachata. I felt like I learned the most by dancing at those events, so I’m hoping to make it to the December event when the semester ends and dead week starts.

	I attended “Halloween Dance Party with Live Latin Music!” at Gio’s on October 27th with Emmanuel. From 8-11pm we worked the event by setting up, checking people in, etc. Once we were done, we stayed to dance and ran into Alejandro and some of his friends. With Alejandro leading the calls, we danced several rueda songs. It was exciting because Alejandro taught threw some of the more complex moves at us, such as enchufla doble con dile que no and setenta. I thoroughly enjoyed the rueda because we had a small group of only 3-4 couples. However, one of the couples had never danced rueda and did not know what the calls meant, so that messed up our flow a little bit. Salsa rueda is interesting because it relies on everybody understanding what to do and keeping a certain amount of energy. When one lead or follow is off, it affects other couples as well. But that is one of the things that makes salsa rueda so fun- it requires teamwork.
	Besides dancing rueda, we danced salsa and bachata. I decided to attempt leading Emmanuel, since I had recently learned about liquid lead following. I found bachata to be much easier to lead, as it is typically slower. Salsa was harder because I tend to: 1) start by stepping back like a follow instead of stepping forward, 2) forget which way to turn the follow so that they are comfortable, and 3) signal in a very casual manner which my follow often interprets as a different move. Of course, at this event I had not had very much practice as a lead, so it makes sense that I was struggling, but I found that I felt pretty discouraged when my leading was not good. I definitely have more appreciation for people who start off leading. It’s a tough job. Honestly, I prefer following because I love to spin and be sassy, but I want to become good at leading to break gender norms. I just need to keep practicing at events like this one.

I went to the salsa @ cal fall fiesta at gio's Pizza and bocce. It was a fun event, and I'm very happy that I went. I hope salsa @ Cal has more events like this.

The dancing experience was definitely very different from class. For example, there wasn't that much space. I spent the first 30 minutes trying to figure out how to not accidentally step on people. This taught me the usefulness of closed position as a way of stopping your partner from crashing into someone. It was also fun just dancing with lots of people. I also liked how there was a lesson before the social dance, as it was fun to participate in and gave us a quick refresher.

Dancing dances that we don’t do in class was also fun, as I had no idea what to do, and just imitated everyone else. For example, the meringue.

Using crossbody changes was very applicable to dancing at gio's, as it was a very useful way of not crashing into people. Also double (I’ve never seen this word written down, so please forgive me) antrufilos were really fun and a good way to stop the aforementioned crashing into others.

Overall I thought the experience was really enjoyable and I had a lot of fun. I'm kind of sad there hasn't been an event for several weeks, so I’m really excited for the next one!

 How To: Teach A Salsa Party Lesson
Written 11.24.2013 by André Crabb
This document goes through what should be taught at a Salsa Party basic lesson. Its good to keep in mind that the audience will be both DeCal students as well as complete beginners. What’s listed below is a good start for anyone’s first lesson who wants to get a feel for what salsa is like.

Note: This should all be completed in 45 min - 1 hour.

Have leaders and follows get in lines, facing each other.
Have the teachers stand in between the lines, also facing each other.
Teach footwork/counting for leaders & follows at the same time.
forward/back basic
side to side basic
back rock basic
Play a song, switching between the basics
Teach the Right Turn footwork, leaders and follows.
Practice it a few times with them.
Play another song, mixing in all basics as well as Right Turns.
Now have them pair up and make a circle around the teachers.
Have them practice their forward/back basic together a little.
Teach the leaders how to lead the Follow’s Right Turn.
Teach leaders how to turn on their own.
Play a song for them to practice.
Teach a different move (and how to get out of it):
Cross Body Lead
Hammerlock
Cuddle
Play a song for them to practice.
The 45 minutes / 1 hour should be over by now. Open it up to social dancing! :D

When vacancies arise in the board, (previous board members will recommend new members to become officers) new officers will be selected through an application and interview process by the existing officers. Members will be invited to submit a written application for the position, which the existing officers will review as a group. They will then offer interviews to the applicants of their choice and select a new officer from them. 

Unless circumstances are extenuating, new officer selection will be done at the beginning each semester, following which the outgoing officers will train their replacements for the remainder of the semester, and the new officers will begin their terms the following semester. An officer may be removed from office by a two-thirds majority vote of the executive committee, or by a two-thirds majority vote of the active members. Members must be notified at least two weeks in advance of such a vote.

The qourum (i.e. the minimum number of members present such that the proceedings at that meeting are valid) is three. Meeting times will be decided by consensus among the officers and/or active members, and members will be notified via email of the time and location of each meeting. There will not be a call for special emergency meetings. 

ARTICLE VI : Constitutional Amendments
A constitutional amendment may be proposed by any active member and should be presented at a meeting in writing. If a member wishes to propose an amendment at a meeting, he or she should notify the officers, who will then notify the members via email. Members must be notified of a vote on an amendment at least two weeks before the vote is to be held.

Remaining privately-obtained funds may be donated to another nonprofit organization with prior approval of the ASUC Senate Finance Committee.

EMAIL SUMMARY

sdacboard@googlegroups.com - email this address to reach the board
salsadanceatcal@lists.berkeley.edu - this is to reach everyone that’s signed up
salsadanceatcal@gmail.com - password: salsa2011   - use this account to reach the entire club, give it out when people want to reach you about club stuff
salsadecal@gmail.com - password: salsa2011    - use this account to reach the decal

Note: salsadanceatcal and salsadecal are two separate accounts, but are connected, so you can sign into either, and see the email of the other as well as send as the other.

STARTING UP THE DECAL: semesterly basis
Paperwork: You will want to be in touch with Rebecca Chavez (rebeccaisme@berkeley.edu), who handles our paperwork.
http://www.decal.org/start-a-course/seven-steps/ This is useful, but starting last semester, the paperwork for the Spring 2012 semester has changed, and this is the link: http://vpapf.chance.berkeley.edu/specialstudies/Course_Proposal_Packet.pdf
Some tips: 
we offer both the 98 and 198 course  
instructor of record name: Mary Kelsey (mkelsey@berkeley.edu)
The first four questions should be on the syllabus (which you should revise each semester to fit these requirements – I’ve already revised it to fit Spring 2012 – or at least change the date so the DeCal board thinks we’ve been making changes)
Question 5 will require an answer on a separate page
In addition to this sheet, you will also need to fill out the second page of the Independent Study Application (already uploaded in the gdoc folder under School Forms). This is the breakdown:
Class time: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Reading: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Presentations: 10 hrs/presentation x 1 presentation
Writing: 2.5 hrs/journal x 2 journals
IF the required amount of hours for a unit changes, make changes accordingly!
You will also need to submit the syllabus (also uploaded under school forms, entitled Salsa Syllabus F11 v2)
Make sure you get Mary Kelsey (454 Barrows) to sign everything!
Submit the forms to Rebecca, who is next door to Mary (door to the left).
Rebecca will most likely give the paperwork herself to the DeCal board, but just in case, make 2ish copies for yourselves in case somebody needs it and Rebecca has the paperwork.
If she asks, 30 is the target enrollment
Do NOT ask for CECs, open CCNs are fine
Difference: open CCNs mean you just give those who make it into the decal the different CCNs (one for the 98, another for 198) and CECs means each person has an entry code and is a huge hassle, especially if one drops or whatever.
Room scheduling:
Rebecca will give you a 30-person room. KEEP THIS ROOM, as if the campus room scheduling falls through, you will need this room.
You should also reserve a room as a student group. The bigger the possible… You know the drill. 
Arcy, you said you might be able to do this via caucus? This would be grand, because you know how we have many problems doing this.
The online form is at http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/studentgrps.html 
This is on a first-come, first-served basis so this must be done quickly!
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS IN THE FALL SEMESTER, make sure there are 4 signatories prior to this because all clubs have to be revalidated before the academic year starts.
For the room in Hearst Gym, contact Brent Atkinson. His email is brentuc@berkeley.edu and his phone number is 510-643-0604. Email him first –Kevin says he is slow to respond, but he responded within 9ish days for me—but if he doesn’t respond, email again. And if he doesn’t respond then, call him.
Say that the salsa DECAL (and not club) needs Hearst Gym, but we will actually be using it for Tuesday classes, so tell him you want it on Tuesdays. This is the template I used when emailing him:
Hi Brent,

I am the new facilitator of the Salsa Dance DeCal this coming year(semester). We’ll be doing the DeCal once again in the Fall(Spring), and would like to use Hearst. Our top choices would be 8-10pm on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. Please let me know if this would work. Thanks for your help!

Sincerely,
Jenna Hang
Email him early on – now would be the opportune time.
He may ask for a copy of the DeCal paperwork – if so, give him a copy.
Eshelman Space Allocation: turn in the paperwork before the end of April (end of spring semester) to have a space for the following academic year.
DeCal website: The DeCal board will send you information regarding how to access the website in the fall.
Since this is the spring semester, you may have to log in with my info from last semester – if this is the case, the information is
Login: jenna.hang@berkeley.edu
pw: 6a4b8f4be
Admissions Process
Set up an application using Google Forms – this will have a form like one you usually see, but all the information will come into the Google Excel doc. This is the doc you see when we read the apps. Just use the same questions as years previous, but if you would like to, make up your own.
Come time to choose who is in the DeCal, cap it at 24 students; 12 leads and 12 followers. This leaves room for 6 more students to be on the waitlist (3 leads and 3 follows). This was complicated last year because we did not leave room for a waitlist.
BE ON TOP OF YOUR EMAILS at this time. Once you have determined who will be on what, give them the CCNs. They are in the email from Rebecca that I forwarded to each of you.
Don’t start too early. We started everything within the first two weeks of class, and this is bad timing – people are still unsure if they can stay in the DeCal. Hold the first day of class (which is really the info session) about the third week of school, and then have applications due a week later. This gives people time to hear about the club and we don’t have to scramble holding 3 different info sessions. I also foresee less drops from the accepted applicants if we do it this way.
Once the DeCal has started, the assignments and everything have already been uploaded. Kevin also has a doc filled with the emails he sent out each week – I used them, made a few changes, so plan accordingly. I have added the email I sent out for the different styles of salsa lecture that we had this semester – it is up to you if you would like to keep that topic or change it.
Send out the history of salsa reading/syllabus before the first official day of class. They should have already read everything before the first day, so that they are ready for the lecture.
Make a decal list-serve if you’d like. I did it because I was too lazy to input 30 emails every time I sent an email. Make sure to CC the other coords though so they know what’s up.
STARTING UP/MAINTAINING THE CLUB
Cal Day is nice, but I don’t think it is a big concern because they are prospective students. We get most of our members from Calapalooza in the fall semester.
I don’t know if this is a yearly thing, but I had to revise the constitution and turn it in at the end of the year last year, but it may have been because we had changed our name from Social Ballroom Club to Salsa Dance at Cal, and then to just Salsa Dance.
CHECK ON THIS, because this is a hazy area for me.
The constitution should be uploaded already.

The Big Give 2025 Alumni Email
Dear {{Name}},
Hope you’re doing well! We are the new generation of UC Berkeley's Salsa@Cal and we are excited to reach out to our great network of alumni! If you didn’t know, there is an annual fundraiser offered by the university called “The Big Give” which is an opportunity to receive donations from family, friends, and alumni. This fundraiser will begin tonight (03/12/25) at 9PM PDT. This event only runs for 24 hours. Salsa@Cal could really use your support! 
We all know how special this club is—memories of late-night social dancing, prepping for performances, or just the amazing people we’ve met along the way. Since the 2020 pandemic, we have rebuilt our club from the ground up, experiencing significant growth, and are now recognized as a Latin dancing community on campus. Our mission is to gain recognition throughout the Bay Area and beyond! 
Your generous donations will help support initiatives such as organizing additional social events, providing Salsa@Cal merchandise, funding workshops, and covering costs for costumes and studio rentals for performances.
Please consider donating—every little bit helps! Here is the link:
https://givingday.berkeley.edu/giving-day/90821/donate?dept=102168
In addition to our fundraising efforts, this email also serves as an opportunity to get to know our alumni personally in order to build stronger relationships. If you are interested in reconnecting, we would be delighted to invite you to some of our upcoming events!
We’d love to keep the Salsa@Cal spirit alive for future dancers, and it means a lot to have alumni like you cheering us on. Hope to see you on the dance floor again sometime!
Take care,
Salsa@Cal

FALL 25 BOARD APPLICATION

Timeline
- COMMITTEE APPLICATION DUE SATURDAY, AUGUST 22nd @11:59PM 
- DECISIONS OUT ON AUGUST 25th!

Salsa at Cal Committee Members will meet on a date below*

WHAT IS SALSA AT CAL? (not that you guys need an introduction)
Salsa at Cal is a group of university students who would like to spread their appreciation and knowledge of salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus and to the surrounding community. We primarily function as a Registered Student Organization, DeCal, and dance/cultural community. 
We teach a weekly series of beginner and intermediate classes in Hearst Gym as part of our for-credit DeCal course for students only. As an RSO, we host dance events, trips to local clubs, and FREE classes in Salsa and other styles. We are also open to performance bookings and host private classes upon request. We've taught everything from Rueda Cubana to Bachata, but our main focus is on Salsa. Dancers of all levels--from complete beginners looking to learn for the first time, to seasoned Salseres just looking for a fun crowd to dance with--are welcome in our classes and events, and no partner is required. 
As a club, Salsa at Cal strives to create spaces in which Latine students can learn, grow, and celebrate our experiences through social dancing; while also providing all students of different backgrounds the opportunity to respect, experience, and learn about Latin music, culture, and dance. 
--------------------------------------
Committees
 
External Affairs    Led by Emmanuel Ceja and Rene Gallegos
External Affairs is tasked with ensuring the successful execution of events Salsa at Cal will be a part of. We are responsible for responding to collaboration requests from other organizations and completing the work necessary to see it through. In this committee we are looking for people who are organized, reliable, good with interpersonal relations, and interested in helping Salsa at Cal grow and host more events for the Berkeley community. 

Internal Affairs    Led by Matthew Robillard
Internal Affairs serves as the basis of communication between not only other committees but also general club members. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: staying up to date with filtering and forwarding email to each respective committee (answering questions when able); organizing/ coordinating internal club events, social gatherings, and any other activities related to club engagement and bonding; attending and taking notes of general and/or board meetings; help running communication channels; working closely with Finance committee and staying up-to-date with the ASUC body. 

Marketing    Led by Kacey Yoe
The Marketing Committee is looking for people to contribute to building Salsa at Cal's brand within the UC Berkeley community and beyond! We take on projects that fall into Content Creation, Publicity, and Communications. Content Creation tackles documentation and editing for lifestyle and promotional content on our social media platforms. Publicity deals with Salsa at Cal’s advertising, promoting the club offline and online through on-campus tabling and Instagram graphics. Communications organizes our monthly newsletters and calendars to keep our internal and external community well-connected. You will have the opportunity to focus on one or multiple aspects of Marketing, collaborate with other Salsa at Cal committees, and enhance your creativity, communication, and technical skills.



CAL Latin Fusion Team  Led by Kathy Reyes
Our Performance Team enables intermediate and advanced dancers to take their skills to the next level in a performance setting. Our performance team is led by Kathy Reyes and places greater emphasis dancing technique and fundamentals then many of our other offerings, which are often geared towards social dancing. Performance team members dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to mastering the choreography, which extends far beyond memorizing a series of patterns. 
Our current performance is a Latin Fusion team, which mixes different types of Latin and Afro dance through choreography. To find out more about our team, feel free to contact us through our email
If interested in the performance committee, you will also be required to join a performance orientation on September 6th at 1PM

I want to join the Decal but it’s too late

Hi [NAME],

Unfortunately, our DeCal applications closed on Friday, [DATE], and our enrollment forms are already finalized. However, you are more than welcome to apply next semester. Otherwise, you will still get opportunities to dance and be part of our community through the events we host throughout the semester!

We host Open Prácticas every Tuesday night from 8:30 to 10 PM under the Social Science Tunnel. No partner or prior experience is required! Each session begins with a beginner-friendly lesson, making it the perfect opportunity to learn and dance. We hope to see you there!

You can keep up with what we have going on through our Instagram or our mailing list. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

--------------------
PERFORMANCE INTERVIEWS 

What is Ari looking for in Performers?
+ Notes disclaimer
+ Rundown of interview/explanation of purpose 
+ Introduction - sets a friendly base 
+ asks for introduction about him → notes interest in applicant as well 
+ asks availability for practice times
+ integrates feedback
+ asks how they feel about performing the responsibilities involved in role – is specific
+ catches comments they make and builds up on them 
+ clarifies any questions at the end 


Wants to join because he misses to dance and used to dance a lot in Peru 
Applying as a Lead 
Doesn’t feel stressed about it because likes to do it, so will make “as much time as you need” 
More about experience on salsa and bachata and how he feels about PERFORMING both: 
Dances since a kid, did a lot of social dancing growing up 
ABOUT PERFORMING → has NEVER performed for others, but is enthusiastic about doing it and sees it as a “privilege” 
Performances: knows many steps and thinks he could contribute a lot of steps that he we don’t know, he is comfortable with sharing them with us 
What would he contribute if accepted: share knowledge of new steps and also participation in ALL the meetings we have, all the practices, would be very committed.
More about practicing choreography to perform, vs. social dancing, are you okay with this? → i think it is different, but i am okay with it, and i think i am happy with it because i've never done it and it's a new experience

--------------------
Hello to all the amazing people who applied to the History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance Decal for Fall 2021!

Thank you all for submitting your applications on time and for the patience you have had with our team this semester. It was an incredibly competitive semester and choosing between all your applications was very difficult. 

We informed everyone that the Salsa at Cal team would send out decision emails today. Because we have yet to find a space that accommodates us this semester, we ask for you all to remain patient until tomorrow when we have more concrete information on how many people, according to University standards, we can accept into the course. 

We are very sorry for this inconvenience but we promise to let you know more as soon as we can. 

Best,
Salsa at Cal

Timestamp: 2025-08-17 01:06:33.778453
--------------------
DeCal Schedule Spring 2025 
Location: Hearst Gym 242
Beginner Class: 4-5 PM 
Intermediate Section: 5-6 PM 
Open Practica: Tuesdays 8:30-10 PM by the Social Sciences Building

When requested, DeCal Salsistants will receive 1-2 units P/NP if they can meet these attendance commitments and responsibilities. Below we will be outlining DeCal Salsistant responsibilities. Please take your time to review them before showing up to class!
Attendance Policy 
Salsistants are expected to show up to every section they committed to on their application for the entirety of the semester. We will allow up to 3 absences (1 unexcused absence; 2 with 24-hour prior notice) 
Salsistants are expected to show up on time to their sections, and to stay for the entirety of their sections
**Salsistants who noted availability for both beginner and intermediate, but who can only attend 1 section, will be assigned a section. When possible, preference will be considered, but ultimately sections will be assigned to even out the number of facilitators.**  
In-Class/Open Practica Responsibilities 
Expected to know how to dance both (at least basics) the Lead and Follow + volunteer for either role as needed
Look out for students who may need additional help while the instructors are answering questions.
Ask GUIDING QUESTIONS: When you realize a student is struggling, ask the instructors a guiding question that may be useful for the student. Especially important/useful for the beginner section.
If pairs are even, Salsistants will not sit out, but pair up and jump into the circle. 
The purpose of this is so that when a switch happens, students are able to dance with experienced dancers (aka you!) and get a feel for the proper communication they should be receiving (aka good tension, proper hand placements, etc) and get one-on-one feedback...Plus, this way you can practice too!  
Assist in Warm Up demonstration. Able to substitute for an instructor (Lead or Follow).
Salsistants have the responsibility of helping students perform/record their Final Performances if unexpected complications arise (ex: their partner sprains an ankle and a lead/follow needs to step in). However your role is limited to helping them learn the moves rather than giving them ideas and choreography tips, as it should be based on their own creativity
Lastly, 
Salsistants must keep a professional attitude during class times (ex: DO NOT hit on the person you’re helping out during class times; Do not disrupt the class; Please be courteous to instructors when they are teaching/speaking.) 
Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet 
Please review the Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet if you have any questions, concerns, or already know of planned absences so we can update the schedule accordingly.
Enrollment 
If you requested units, you should be enrolled on CalCentral If you enroll for units, you are required to consistently abide by the Responsibilities & Attendance Policy, whether you are only participating in one section per week or multiple. 
Communication 
Please join the DeCal Salsistant groupchat for updates ASAP!!

Thank you for your commitment & enthusiasm towards the DeCal. We appreciate your presence and look forward to welcoming you into the DeCal Squad!!

DeCal Instructors Guide

Description: 
The goal of this position is to teach the students about the history and culture of salsa dancing and music. Music evolves in many ways throughout generations but we are here to emphasize where salsa came from to not let the knowledge die. The salsa dancing we are teaching is LA style and is very different from the original. We teach on “the one” and focus on structure/form. We also avoid gender roles and promote respect and consent. Make sure to emphasize that anyone can be in the position of a follow or lead. And MOST IMPORTANTLY you MUST include a lesson on respect and consent. 
Being in the Instructor role puts you in a position of leadership. People will look up to you so be welcoming and respectful to your students. Make clear to them that if they are ever uncomfortable they should reach out to you for accommodations. Be in communication with your salsistants. And if you see something, say something. 

Other than class time, you are responsible for showing up to Open Practica. 
If there is ever a time where you can not go to class or Open Practica, communicate with fellow instructors.  

Responsibilities:
Take attendance 
Set classroom expectations
Set a lesson plan for the week 
Publish Modules/Assignments 
Announce assignments 
Pair randomly for final performances

(To use in email/other formats to introduce us for events)

My name is ___, and I am the event coordinator for the famous Salsa @ Cal Club. We are the UC Berkeley-based club for Latin Dance enthusiasts and learners, with a main focus on salsa and bachata. I am reaching out to see if you would be interested in having us host our next salsa event at your location.

We are hoping to hold the event on (Friday, November 30th, from 9pm-1:45am). If this is not possible, we are also interested in the same time slot for (Saturday, December 1st). 

This event consists of an hour-long salsa and bachata lesson, followed by social dancing. We have a following of over 2,000 dancers, and are known for our DeCal salsa classes and on and off campus events. In the past have brought in over 200 people per event, and with the space provided by your location, can expect an even higher number. While we do have participants who are under age, there are also many over 21, so there will definitely be drink revenue from which your bar will benefit. We have our own DJ, who brings his own equipment and plays a variety of Latin Dance music.

For this particular event, we have a (Christmas Masquerade/Carnival) theme, where we will provide masks for participants and encourage them to dress up. We also hope to set up some decorations in the hour or so before the event.       (If needed, can include: Our pre-sale tickets are $10/person for the days prior to the day of the event, and $12 for the day of until 5pm. At the door ticket prices are $15.)

Thank you / Best,

File: /content/unzipped_files/Past Events/Hiring a DJ.docx
Timestamp: 2025-08-17 01:06:33.786453
--------------------
Guidelines to Hiring a DJ 

When hiring a DJ to come and play for one of Salsa at Cal’s parties, you need these requirements in order to have a successful party. 

The DJ is responsible for providing:
A good selection of danceable music for people to dance
Helps keep the experience dancers dancing throughout the party
Helps create a good atmosphere and brings energy to the party
Helps bring more people to come to future Salsa at Cal parties
Make any special announcements requested by the Salsa at Cal
Advertises for that particular Salsa at Cal’s party    
   
If the DJ meet these requirements, expect to have good turn out. In terms of paying a DJ, you need to evaluate the DJ through their experience, skill, and where they have play before, and what kind of music they normally play, and what kind of crowd they bring to the dance floor. We recommend to go listen to the DJ before contacting them to play for one of Salsa at Cal’s parties. Do not base your decision to hire a DJ solely through a friendship or doing a favor for them because this will affect Salsa at Cal reputation and future parties. 

How much you should pay a DJ:
$100 dollars = Decent
$125 dollars = Experience 
$150 dollars = Expert / Well known 

If the DJ is not doing his/her responsibilities, then you can deduct some money from what it was originally proposed to him / her. You can deduct –$25 dollars, if the DJ does one of the following things.

Ways to deduct money from the DJ:
He/She is not playing the music that we request or advertise in the event
He/She is dancing during the party or is not always in the DJ post during the party
He/She is letting a device play the music for the whole party
He/She promises to bring his / her DJ equipment, but fails do so
He/She damages Salsa at Cal’s DJ equipment 
He/She arrives 10 minutes late to the party
He/She fails to keep dancers to stay for the whole duration of the event or people start to leave the party

Multicultural Initiative Fund (MIF) Rubric
*this rubric is intended to guide the assessment and determination of funding levels for proposals submitted - NOTE that this rubric provides a framework for evaluation and funding decisions, and additional factors may be considered during the review process

Please describe your organization and its purpose (max 100 words)
Salsa at Cal is a group of university students who would like to spread their appreciation and knowledge of Salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus. We host social dancing events and classes, trips to local clubs, and FREE classes in Salsa and other styles. We also host a DeCal named “History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance” each semester. We've taught everything from Rueda Cubana, Merengue, and Bachata, but our main focus is on Salsa.

Does your organization or proposal receive funding from other avenues? If so, from where?
No, our organization has historically lacked funding.Initiative/Proposal

This section is intended to provide insight into how your organization would use any funds allocated to you from the MIF. This is the most important section, be thorough.
What is the intended outcome of your proposal/initiative in terms of its effect on a community? How does this proposal/initiative address a multicultural goal? (max 100 words)
As a club, we have always wanted to serve the broader underrepresented and marginalized community on campus. Our proposal is for an event called Salsa Prom. We have never done an event this big due to a lack of resources and funding. We hope that this on-campus event can bring salsa and bachata lovers to one single space where their diverse backgrounds are celebrated through dance and music.

What amount are you applying for? (ex: $1,000)
$5,000+

Have you applied to MIF before? If so, describe your experience. Put N/A if this is your first time applying.

Please answer each question in the rubric above!
Our intention with Salsa Prom and other future events is to cater to all student demographics regardless of cultural and ethnic background. 
Salsa Prom will serve all underrepresented student populations. At an institution as large as UC Berkeley, it can be a daunting task to discover communities and spaces that not only celebrate but openly receive those of familiar AND different cultural backgrounds. We recognize how intimate and cathartic it can be to share spaces with those who also identify with the same marginalized and oppressed experiences. As a result, we understand that most of our students 
We at Salsa at Cal appreciate that Berkeley will benefit from a rise in non-exclusive spaces that welcome members of diverse cultural backgrounds. We prioritize doing away with the exclusivity and all too-common gaps between different student organizations.  
YES. All events that Salsa at Cal hosts are aimed at recruitment and retention. We believe in the great importance of daily steps toward a larger body of students to be a part of our board and DeCal, or even just attend the many events we host!  



Please describe your organization and its purpose (max 400 words)

Founded in 2009, Salsa at Cal is a culturally diverse group of UC Berkeley students that strive to spread appreciation and awareness of the historical roots of Salsa and other Latin dances while engaging the local community. We teach a weekly DeCal titled “History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance” each Fall and Spring semester. We host affordable social dances, trips to local clubs, and FREE instructional classes in Salsa and other styles. We’ve taught everything from Rueda Cubana, Merengue, Bachata, and - of course - traditional Salsa. Prior to Covid-19, Salsa at Cal would utilize campus resources (dance rooms located inside Hearst Gym and Eshleman Hall) to host low-stakes practice sessions for DeCal students and board members. However, in the wake of the Pandemic, we found ourselves in a financial situation where office hours needed to be reformatted from classroom spaces to becoming hosted in the tunnel near the Social Science Building as“Open Practica”. Most recently during the Fall 2024 semester, we’ve expanded our availability and knowledge to reach all students regardless of affiliation with the Salsa at Cal DeCal or board. 		





What is your intended initiative? Include some details on the scope ex: the number of attendees  (max 250 words)

As a club, we have always wanted to serve the underrepresented communities on campus. Our proposal is for an event called “Salsa Prom”. Salsa at Cal would not be able to host an event this large due to a lack of resources and funding. We hope that this on-campus event can bring Salsa and Bachata lovers to one single space where their diverse backgrounds are celebrated through dance and music. This event is being planned with the intention of attendance to be affordable, not exclusively for students of historically marginalized backgrounds, but the larger community of Berkeley. To host more events such as Salsa Prom, we will require updated speakers, camera and tripod, DJ equipment, microphones, and a tent that can be used for promotional purposes throughout campus. Open Practica and reservations for social dancing on Upper Sproul, for example, would benefit with the addition of the speakers and microphones we are budgeting for. The equipment that we will be purchasing is versatile for promotional purposes of Salsa Prom in addition to future events that won’t require extraneous amounts of funds.

What is the outcome of your proposal/initiative in terms of its effect on a community?

Our proposal aims to foster an inclusive community united through music and dance. Through “Salsa Prom”, we envision creating a vibrant space on campus where individuals from diverse backgrounds can come together to celebrate their love for Salsa and Bachata. We hope that this initiative will create an affordable and welcoming environment, not only for students, but also for the broader Berkeley community. This event is intended to bridge cultural gaps, highlight the diversity within our community, and celebrate the shared passion for Latin dance and music.

What amount are you applying for? (ex: $1,000)

$10,000

What is the minimum amount your organization can receive in order to complete your initiative? (ex: $1000)

$9,000

Have you applied to MIF before? If so, 

1. What years did your organization apply and how much funding was received 
And 2. Describe your experience with MIF. Put N/A if this is your first time applying.

We at Salsa at Cal previously applied to the MIF in the Spring 2024 semester. We were allocated a total of $5,000. 

If your event is a ticketed event how much money did you make last year? Were these funds used to break even? Please upload an image of this total amount. If your event is not ticketed, please respond with N/A.
For Salsa Prom 24’,  unfortunately we did not break even and our net profit was $-1154. The organizers of the event gave us a capacity restriction of 110 number of attendance, resulting in an additional obstacle for community access. We promoted a presale of $20 for students and $25 for General admission. On the day of the event, our prices are $25 per student and $30 for General admission. 


Does your organization or proposal receive funding from other avenues? If so, from where?

Yes, we have received our first wave of funding from the 2024-2025 ASUC Allocations and funding application. However, this amount is not a sufficient sum for Salsa at Cal to comfortably secure an adequate venue for Salsa Prom.

I went with my girlfriend to this event called Orquesta La Farandula Live at Soho on October 20th in Santa Barbara, CA. It was my 1st time seeing my girlfriend since the start of the class, so I tried to teach her a lot of the moves we learned in class before the event. We got there and there was 2 dance floors to choose from, a salsa dance floor and a bachata dance floor. We 1st decided to go to the bachata dance floor as that one was closer to the door and there were less people dancing on it. It was interesting to see that some people were just there to sit at the tables around the dance floors and just sit and chat. Some people didn’t actually dance with someone all night. The crowd of people there a bit older and didn’t seem of college age. As such there were a lot of experienced couples the dance floor. I tried to learn some of the moves they were doing and learned a few new moves from watching them. The alcohol was flowing, so I found it a bit easier to just lose myself in the dancing and tried to not focus on counting steps, but rather just trying to learn how to lead. We went over to the salsa floor, but it was a lot more packed and the dance floor was bigger. It seemed like the event was mostly people who wanted to dance salsa and only a handful of bachateros. The salsa side seemed a bit more lively with people dancing multiple styles. We spent most of the night on the dance floor only taking a break for a margarita. That’s when I really started to people watch and noticed the scene. There was a salsa performance that was pretty interesting, but sadly we were a little bit too far back to really get the full effect of the music. The most fun part was being able to see what people are doing and be able to break it down into steps counts. That is something I think i learned in the Decal that really comes in handy when out social dancing. After we left the event we took asked someone to take a picture, who turned out to be one of the birthdays that were being celebrated at this event! All in all it was a pretty fun event. Here’s the picture

The day leading up to my first salsa social event, I was a nervous wreck. I had only been in the beginners decal for a couple weeks! How would I be able to follow more advanced dancers who knew moves I had never even heard of? Why would anyone want to dance with someone who can only do the LA basic step and a J-turn? When I actually arrived to Gio’s and got the first lesson out of the way, my entire attitude flipped. I had no idea how fun social dancing could be, no matter what level dancer you are.
	I didn’t expect there to be such a wide variety of leading styles. It was really interesting to try and catch on to a lead’s patterns and predict what move they would orchestrate next. When I danced with my fellow decal beginners, this was pretty easy to do; we all learned the same two or three turns and practiced them on repeat. The more seasoned dancers, on the other hand, were a challenge! It was like playing chess when you’ve only ever played checkers. They would chain moves together so quickly that I couldn’t even remember what count I was on. I completely abandoned my footwork and just tried to spin when I they signaled.
One older man asked me to dance and I gladly accepted, thinking he would be more my speed. Little did I know, he was a salsa connoisseur! (Or at least, what I considered to be a connoisseur as a super-duper beginner). I probably had the most fun of all dancing with him, because it was the first time I really noticed the difference in leading style. After that dance, I focused a lot on keeping my steps small and staying on my toes in order to follow each lead better. Even when dancing bachata—which I hadn’t done before—it wasn’t too difficult to follow when I thought less about the counts and more about matching the leads. 
Although I have learned a lot more salsa moves since then, I still think that social dancing at Gio’s was the best (and most fun) way to improve my salsa dancing.

Welcome to Salsa@Cal!

We are a community of dancers at the University of California, Berkeley, who provide free dance instructions and social events for the UC Berkeley community. All of us love dancing because it is a way to express to the music we love in happy, cheerful and fun manners. The most important thing for us is to make sure that our members are having fun and enjoying themselves while dancing. That way we can grow a community filled with joy.
Our full list of offerings and our dances are outlined further in this site with the major attractions being our free dance lesson offerings and our regular dance socials and parties. All of our offering and event require *no partner* so just show up and we will show teach how to dance or maybe you will teach us a thing or two.
Check out our event feed on the right of the page outlining our upcoming lessons and events and make sure to follow us on social media on these channels. Here is also a guideline for what you can do to get more involved in our community:
I’m a beginner dancer and want to learn how to dance
I’m an intermediate dancer and want to continue to improve
I’m an advanced dancer and want to take my skills to the next level
If you would like to support our efforts and like what we offer, we would be very happy to make you part of our community. Please see the “Give to Salsa@Cal” section for more details.


Our Dances

Salsa
History	

	From Wikipedia:

The name "salsa" has been described as the dance since the mid-1970s. The use of the term for the dance started in New York. It evolved from earlier Cuban dance forms such as Son, Son Montuno, Cha cha cha and Mambo which were popular in the Caribbean, Latin America and the Latino communities in New York since the 1940s. Salsa, like most music genres has gone through a lot of variation through the years and incorporated elements of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dances such as Guaguanco and Pachanga. Different countries of the Caribbean and Latin America have distinct salsa styles of their own, such as Cuban, Colombian, Puerto Rican and New York styles.
There is some controversy surrounding the origins of the word salsa. Some claim that it was based on a cry shouted by musicians while they were playing their music. Others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music, who chose the word "salsa" because of its spicy and hot connotations. Still others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles, just like salsa or "sauce" in Latin American countries is a mixture of different ingredients.
	Our Salsa

Salsa@Cal offers many ways for you to learn and improve your salsa skills
 Our DeCal has a beginner and an intermediate section that allows you to learn and practice in an organized fashion from our dedicated student instructors. The DeCal is held each semester and involves and application process due to high student demand.
Our Open Practica series offers drop-in lessons for beginner and intermediate dancers. The series is open to everyone and requires no dance partner to join. Each week our student instructors will prepare a 1 hour lesson for the community and then open the floor to social dancing for another hour.
Our Salsa Performance Team enables intermediate and advanced dancers to take their skills to the next level in a performance setting. The performance team requires dedication to mastering dancing technique and perform a choreography designed by one of our student leaders. Given the time and effort our choreographers put into the performance, we expect our performance team members to be dedicated to the team’s efforts and devote the time and effort required to make the performance the best it can be.

EMAIL SUMMARY

sdacboard@googlegroups.com - email this address to reach the board
salsadanceatcal@lists.berkeley.edu - this is to reach everyone that’s signed up
salsadanceatcal@gmail.com - password: salsa2011   - use this account to reach the entire club, give it out when people want to reach you about club stuff
salsadecal@gmail.com - password: salsa2011    - use this account to reach the decal

Note: salsadanceatcal and salsadecal are two separate accounts, but are connected, so you can sign into either, and see the email of the other as well as send as the other.

STARTING UP THE DECAL: semesterly basis
Paperwork: You will want to be in touch with Rebecca Chavez (rebeccaisme@berkeley.edu), who handles our paperwork.
http://www.decal.org/start-a-course/seven-steps/ This is useful, but starting last semester, the paperwork for the Spring 2012 semester has changed, and this is the link: http://vpapf.chance.berkeley.edu/specialstudies/Course_Proposal_Packet.pdf
Some tips: 
we offer both the 98 and 198 course  
instructor of record name: Mary Kelsey (mkelsey@berkeley.edu)
The first four questions should be on the syllabus (which you should revise each semester to fit these requirements – I’ve already revised it to fit Spring 2012 – or at least change the date so the DeCal board thinks we’ve been making changes)
Question 5 will require an answer on a separate page
In addition to this sheet, you will also need to fill out the second page of the Independent Study Application (already uploaded in the gdoc folder under School Forms). This is the breakdown:
Class time: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Reading: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Presentations: 10 hrs/presentation x 1 presentation
Writing: 2.5 hrs/journal x 2 journals
IF the required amount of hours for a unit changes, make changes accordingly!
You will also need to submit the syllabus (also uploaded under school forms, entitled Salsa Syllabus F11 v2)
Make sure you get Mary Kelsey (454 Barrows) to sign everything!
Submit the forms to Rebecca, who is next door to Mary (door to the left).
Rebecca will most likely give the paperwork herself to the DeCal board, but just in case, make 2ish copies for yourselves in case somebody needs it and Rebecca has the paperwork.
If she asks, 30 is the target enrollment
Do NOT ask for CECs, open CCNs are fine
Difference: open CCNs mean you just give those who make it into the decal the different CCNs (one for the 98, another for 198) and CECs means each person has an entry code and is a huge hassle, especially if one drops or whatever.
Room scheduling:
Rebecca will give you a 30-person room. KEEP THIS ROOM, as if the campus room scheduling falls through, you will need this room.
You should also reserve a room as a student group. The bigger the possible… You know the drill. 
Arcy, you said you might be able to do this via caucus? This would be grand, because you know how we have many problems doing this.
The online form is at http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/studentgrps.html 
This is on a first-come, first-served basis so this must be done quickly!
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS IN THE FALL SEMESTER, make sure there are 4 signatories prior to this because all clubs have to be revalidated before the academic year starts.
For the room in Hearst Gym, contact Brent Atkinson. His email is brentuc@berkeley.edu and his phone number is 510-643-0604. Email him first –Kevin says he is slow to respond, but he responded within 9ish days for me—but if he doesn’t respond, email again. And if he doesn’t respond then, call him.
Say that the salsa DECAL (and not club) needs Hearst Gym, but we will actually be using it for Tuesday classes, so tell him you want it on Tuesdays. This is the template I used when emailing him:
Hi Brent,

I am the new facilitator of the Salsa Dance DeCal this coming year(semester). We’ll be doing the DeCal once again in the Fall(Spring), and would like to use Hearst. Our top choices would be 8-10pm on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. Please let me know if this would work. Thanks for your help!

Sincerely,
Jenna Hang
Email him early on – now would be the opportune time.
He may ask for a copy of the DeCal paperwork – if so, give him a copy.
Eshelman Space Allocation: turn in the paperwork before the end of April (end of spring semester) to have a space for the following academic year.
DeCal website: The DeCal board will send you information regarding how to access the website in the fall.
Since this is the spring semester, you may have to log in with my info from last semester – if this is the case, the information is
Login: jenna.hang@berkeley.edu
pw: 6a4b8f4be
Admissions Process
Set up an application using Google Forms – this will have a form like one you usually see, but all the information will come into the Google Excel doc. This is the doc you see when we read the apps. Just use the same questions as years previous, but if you would like to, make up your own.
Come time to choose who is in the DeCal, cap it at 24 students; 12 leads and 12 followers. This leaves room for 6 more students to be on the waitlist (3 leads and 3 follows). This was complicated last year because we did not leave room for a waitlist.
BE ON TOP OF YOUR EMAILS at this time. Once you have determined who will be on what, give them the CCNs. They are in the email from Rebecca that I forwarded to each of you.
Don’t start too early. We started everything within the first two weeks of class, and this is bad timing – people are still unsure if they can stay in the DeCal. Hold the first day of class (which is really the info session) about the third week of school, and then have applications due a week later. This gives people time to hear about the club and we don’t have to scramble holding 3 different info sessions. I also foresee less drops from the accepted applicants if we do it this way.
Once the DeCal has started, the assignments and everything have already been uploaded. Kevin also has a doc filled with the emails he sent out each week – I used them, made a few changes, so plan accordingly. I have added the email I sent out for the different styles of salsa lecture that we had this semester – it is up to you if you would like to keep that topic or change it.
Send out the history of salsa reading/syllabus before the first official day of class. They should have already read everything before the first day, so that they are ready for the lecture.
Make a decal list-serve if you’d like. I did it because I was too lazy to input 30 emails every time I sent an email. Make sure to CC the other coords though so they know what’s up.
STARTING UP/MAINTAINING THE CLUB
Cal Day is nice, but I don’t think it is a big concern because they are prospective students. We get most of our members from Calapalooza in the fall semester.
I don’t know if this is a yearly thing, but I had to revise the constitution and turn it in at the end of the year last year, but it may have been because we had changed our name from Social Ballroom Club to Salsa Dance at Cal, and then to just Salsa Dance.
CHECK ON THIS, because this is a hazy area for me.
The constitution should be uploaded already.

Only ASUC members may hold officer positions in this organization. This section shall not be interpreted to prevent non-ASUC members from holding advisory positions in the organization.

5 All funds, facilities, and resources allocated or provided to this organization by the ASUC (including the Graduate Assembly) during the term of its sponsorship shall remain the property of the ASUC at all times.

In the event that the designated organization no longer exists or has ceased to be a non-profit organization, the distribution shall be made to the ASUC.

14 This organization shall be considered dissolved if it is inactive and (a) fails to register as a student organization with the University for more than five full academic years or (b) it ceases to have any members.

Timestamp: 2025-08-17 01:07:06.553195
--------------------
EXECUTIVE
DeCal Sponsorship
Discounted tickets for Bachata Nightz
DeCal OH Space
Final Performance Room Booking  
ASUC Budget Allocations (needs to be completed by a signatory) 

EXTERNAL 
Suggested Action Items
Update your team on what potential collaborations are coming up. 
What do they think? Any insight to offer? 
Start creating checklists of what would be needed for each upcoming collaboration (ex: Salsistants? Transportation? Costumes? Performance? Speaker?) and reach out to relevant committees for support
Ex: El Mercadito Logistics 
What are we selling? (Brainstorm with all Committees), once decided, 
Prices & Fundraising Logistics? (Reach out → Fundraising)
Who is gonna buy the products we need? 
Who is gonna transport our products to the vending site? 
Day of Logistics? Who is taking shifts? (Reach out → All) 
What do we need to promote our product? (Reach out → Marketing) 
**You can choose to borrow someone from Internal to write this list down during the meeting, or compile it yourselves and then have them oversee its progress after-the-fact since this task is largely internal in nature. Just communicate obligations clearly so there’s no confusion as to who is responsible for doing what. **

Thoughts 
It’ll be vital for your team members to have excellent communication with other Committees + the outside world since much of your job consists of communicating what requests we have; and what we need from each committee to make our events successful. Make sure your team members are aware of this & not afraid to reach out for support when needed!!
Get to know your team. They may have connections, knowledge, and/or networking skills that could benefit the club! 


INTERNAL 
Priority Action Items 
ASSIGN A HISTORIAN AND TAKE NOTES OF MEETING IN REAL TIME!!! 
Once notes are completed, can link to useful links doc
Assist (potentially) in adding new members to shared docs during meeting 
Have a Historian work closely with External to create checklists of what is needed for future collaborations. 
Once External passes this information onto the Club, it is essentially an Internal Operation, meaning Internal should keep track of these checklists and their progress.  
Discuss with your team how to divide Internal responsibilities, give them run-down 
Share IG/email account information as necessary 
Create Templates for quick response
Make sure your team knows how to maintain a cordial tone through written communication. Salsa at Cal is positive & polite, in person & through our communication channels :) 
Talk with your team, be open to suggestions of how to have more efficient organization!! 
Side note: Tristan has taken the responsibility to send out Google Calendar invites as an Executive Member. Since this also kind of overlaps with Internal responsibilities just check in periodically to see if there’s anything he needs help with! 















FINANCE
Priority Action Items 
MIF FUND
Has Finance completed the necessary steps (sent to us by Samantha) to release our Salsa Prom Funds? Do you need any support with this? 
 Everything having to do with the financial logistics of the event.
Ticket pricing? 
Have you scheduled a check-in with Samantha? Do you need other Committee Chairs present? 
Decorations? 

ASUC BUDGET ALLOCATIONS
Work with signatories to get necessary paperwork done by deadlines. 
Who is assigned to this task? 

BIG GIVE 
What do we need to do?
 What other Committees do you need support from? I would need support from everyone who has time to just hangout and dance. 
Marketing: I had an idea about going live on insta and using the big give# that was created. Or doing a Big Give Post for 
Internal Affairs: committee can come in from time to time to answer questions (if we go live on insta. I can also add a link to where people can donate through the big give website.
Performance: if you want to perform something, that would be cool , if we go live. 

EL MERCADITO FUNDRAISER
Lead discussion around what product we should sell at this semester’s Mercadito. 
Chair can assign its members to come up with ideas by a certain deadline.
 
PERFORMANCE FEES 
(**work closely with Performance for this, and present to the Board for feedback when ready**). 
Work with your committee to help draft performance cost policy. 
When do we charge and when do we not? Does it depend on the nature of the event (ex: a charity event versus a private gala?) 
Are we charging per minute? Per number of pairs? Per dance styles included?
What do other dance groups charge for performances? Could be useful to research for comparison. 

Once completed, share with Internal so they can add to the Linktree. 


MARKETING
List of potential material/media we already have to make social media content (Marketing Team has creative freedom and these are just suggestions, but this content is currently not being put to use)
Salsaween Content: Tristan created a shared album of content from last semester’s Salsaween. Should be added to the Salsa at Cal drive and used to make a reel, TikTok, promotional content, etc…
El Mercadito Content: Good quality video of Giselle’s solo exists + performance group picture. Could be used to promote Salsa at Cal’s participation in the upcoming Mercadito. 
Salsa Tropi-Cal Content: This exists and is in the Drive! Doesn’t hurt to check out. 

Suggested Action Items (up to Marketing how you want to prioritize these): 
Alana & Esteban Partnership
They have spammed Milena’s personal DM (she has not opened it) and they have sent multiple messages to Salsa at Cal DM. 
Should speak with other Committees to get input on how to negotiate this partnership. *Keep in mind they have given past free classes to DeCal; served as judges at Final Performances; and their standing in the Bay Area social dancing community when deciding what course to take.  
Board Spotlight Posts but make them Salsa at Cal – we have never been basic so our spotlights shouldn’t be either! 
Begin brainstorming Salsa Prom promotional content
Salsa Story Time Sunday’s? 
History & Culture of Salsa Dance Content (aka informational resources) – could be a highlight on our Instagram??
MORE DANCE CONTENT IN GENERAL 
Milena is sure our following just wants to see us dance! Our dancing content on Instagram has (ironically) declined!!
Can work with Performance Team to film short videos; DeCal videos; casual OH videos; possibilities are endless :D

PERFORMANCE
Priority Tasks 
Set up communication set up: message 
Decide on alternatives times to meet to practice 
Let them know that class with Xavier is mandatory for Performers
If haven’t done already, check email for list of all potential future performance bookings 

Suggested Action Items/Talking Points
Brainstorm some basic performance routines that could be filmed for social media
Get to know your team & their dance levels
Is someone interested (& capable) of performing a solo? Do they all know salsa rueda? Have they ever been on a stage before? 
Explain the differences between social dancing and performing. Introduce some basic ideas of how to carry oneself on-stage, ie stage presence (smiling, forming a connection with the audience, having a strong frame [no sloppy arms, etc])... 
How will you introduce and practice stage presence with your team? Will you incorporate warm-ups where they can practice improving their frame? Their technique? 
***You don’t have to address all of this at the first meeting. These are just things you COULD think about**

MOVING FORWARD: Go back to Salsa or stay back?
BOARD’s OPINION as discussed today:
Last week was an intro to Bachata! (So you can now go out and know what you are doing!)
But, NOW: we will go back and hammer down Salsa!!
On another note: Good job communicating with your students during Office hours
Board input on structure of decal class:
Emphasize basics
Make sure beginners know basics before moving on.
Maybe test them?
Pre-approved lesson plan
Weekly 
Match instruction to exposure
Salsa is harder ← needs to be taught longer?
Intermediate - filter better
Make ‘test’ more formal/systematic?

Maybe create a doc. briefing what assistants need to do.

File: /content/unzipped_files/Spring 2025/Decal/HOW TO - DeCal Salsistant Spring 2025.docx
Timestamp: 2025-08-17 01:07:06.566196
--------------------
DeCal Schedule Spring 2025 
Location: Hearst Gym 242
Beginner Class: 4-5 PM 
Intermediate Section: 5-6 PM 
Open Practica: Tuesdays 8:30-10 PM by the Social Sciences Building

When requested, DeCal Salsistants will receive 1-2 units P/NP if they can meet these attendance commitments and responsibilities. Below we will be outlining DeCal Salsistant responsibilities. Please take your time to review them before showing up to class!
Attendance Policy 
Salsistants are expected to show up to every section they committed to on their application for the entirety of the semester. We will allow up to 3 absences (1 unexcused absence; 2 with 24-hour prior notice) 
Salsistants are expected to show up on time to their sections, and to stay for the entirety of their sections
**Salsistants who noted availability for both beginner and intermediate, but who can only attend 1 section, will be assigned a section. When possible, preference will be considered, but ultimately sections will be assigned to even out the number of facilitators.**  
In-Class/Open Practica Responsibilities 
Expected to know how to dance both (at least basics) the Lead and Follow + volunteer for either role as needed
Look out for students who may need additional help while the instructors are answering questions.
Ask GUIDING QUESTIONS: When you realize a student is struggling, ask the instructors a guiding question that may be useful for the student. Especially important/useful for the beginner section.
If pairs are even, Salsistants will not sit out, but pair up and jump into the circle. 
The purpose of this is so that when a switch happens, students are able to dance with experienced dancers (aka you!) and get a feel for the proper communication they should be receiving (aka good tension, proper hand placements, etc) and get one-on-one feedback...Plus, this way you can practice too!  
Assist in Warm Up demonstration. Able to substitute for an instructor (Lead or Follow).
Salsistants have the responsibility of helping students perform/record their Final Performances if unexpected complications arise (ex: their partner sprains an ankle and a lead/follow needs to step in). However your role is limited to helping them learn the moves rather than giving them ideas and choreography tips, as it should be based on their own creativity
Lastly, 
Salsistants must keep a professional attitude during class times (ex: DO NOT hit on the person you’re helping out during class times; Do not disrupt the class; Please be courteous to instructors when they are teaching/speaking.) 
Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet 
Please review the Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet if you have any questions, concerns, or already know of planned absences so we can update the schedule accordingly.
Enrollment 
If you requested units, you should be enrolled on CalCentral If you enroll for units, you are required to consistently abide by the Responsibilities & Attendance Policy, whether you are only participating in one section per week or multiple. 
Communication 
Please join the DeCal Salsistant groupchat for updates ASAP!!

Thank you for your commitment & enthusiasm towards the DeCal. We appreciate your presence and look forward to welcoming you into the DeCal Squad!!

Music evolves in many ways throughout generations but we are here to emphasize where salsa came from to not let the knowledge die. The salsa dancing we are teaching is LA style and is very different from the original. We teach on “the one” and focus on structure/form. We also avoid gender roles and promote respect and consent. Make sure to emphasize that anyone can be in the position of a follow or lead. And MOST IMPORTANTLY you MUST include a lesson on respect and consent. 
Being in the Instructor role puts you in a position of leadership. People will look up to you so be welcoming and respectful to your students. Make clear to them that if they are ever uncomfortable they should reach out to you for accommodations. Be in communication with your salsistants. And if you see something, say something. 

Other than class time, you are responsible for showing up to Open Practica. 
If there is ever a time where you can not go to class or Open Practica, communicate with fellow instructors.  

Responsibilities:
Take attendance 
Set classroom expectations
Set a lesson plan for the week 
Publish Modules/Assignments 
Announce assignments 
Pair randomly for final performances

{2023 Fall} Student Union RSO Sponsorship Application
The Student Union Programming team brings events and activities to the Student Union for student engagement and development. We have hosted the Boba Welcome Back Social, Bridgerton Tea Party, De-Stress Fest and many more! The Programming team is excited to partner with RSOs in providing fun and relevant activities, which support community-building, to the student body.
The Programming team will partner with RSOs to host/ fund 2-3 large scale events (100+ guests) within the Student Union per semester for student engagement and RSO exposure. Fall 2023 will be the pilot phase therefore we will likely only host one event in October or November.
Along with the sponsorship, the Programming team will also assist in planning the event and offer professional event planning services and marketing for the event. Depending on the nature of the event, the Programming team may recommend that several RSOs collaborate to host one single event. The Student Union will offer up to $5,000 in sponsorship per event.
To apply please fill out the application below by September 26th at noon.  If chosen, the Programming team will contact the group via email by September 29th for further steps. All other groups will receive an email that have not been chosen at this time but are encourage to apply for future opportunities.

Tell us about your organization
Salsa at Cal is a group of university students who would like to spread their appreciation and knowledge of Salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus. We host social dancing events and classes, trips to local clubs, and FREE classes in Salsa and other styles. We also host a DeCal named “History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance” each semester. We've taught everything from Rueda Cubana, Merengue, and Bachata, but our main focus is on Salsa.

How long has your RSO been on campus?
Since 2009

How many members do you have?
Varies; usually from 10-30 per semester 

Please describe the event (theme, activities you are interested in, etc.) 
A Latin social dancing and dance lessons event coupled with a featured performance of these dances by our performance team. A potential name for our event could be Salsa Posada. 

What goals do you anticipate your event will accomplish? Please list 2-3.
We anticipate our proposed event to accomplish facilitating easier access to a common cultural activity, providing a space for the Cal Latine community to come together through one facet of our complex and multi-faceted culture, and to expand the cultural horizons of Cal students by sharing our knowledge of and passion for dance with them. 
We anticipate our event will facilitate access to a common cultural activity
provide a space for the Cal Latine community to come together Our event will teach 

Why are you interested in hosting an event with the Student Union Programming team?
As social dancers ourselves, while there are many opportunities to social dance in Berkeley and the East Bay, we understand that new learners may not feel as comfortable social dancing in these environments with people of all ages and levels of experience. Through an event hosted in conjunction with the Student Union Programming team, we hope to create a space in which beginners and experienced dancers alike can come together and dance with members of their own age group and school community, and learn more about one facet of Latine culture in doing so!

How do you plan to market the event?
Instagram, Facebook, newsletter/mailing list, digital flyers, etc.

Please share your social media profiles (facebook, instagram, etc)
Instagram: @salsaatcalberkeley; Facebook: @salsaatcalberkeley

Have you hosted any events on campus?
Yes

If yes, tell us about what you have hosted before below:
We have hosted multiple community-wide social dancing events in the past year, hosted at Spats in Downtown Berkeley, including Salsaween and Salsa Tropical. Each of these events had gross profits of between $1500 and $2000, with turnouts in the 100s, which we considered to be highly successful considering the capacity of Spats’ event space. As for events on campus that we’ve hosted, pre-pandemic the club has hosted community-wide lessons and events called Open Practicas in which members of the community would be invited to learn to dance alongside students and we would play music on Sproul Plaza so people could put the moves they had learned to work.

If applicable, what is your ideal Student Union location and date for your event? Note: We cannot guarantee the location and date; however, this information is a helpful starting point for planning. 
We were thinking of using the Pauley Ballroom on Thursday, November 9th, since the space is perfect for dancing and has a stage for elevated and more easily visible teaching. As for the date, we thought this would be easily accessible to students because it’s before the holiday weekend and before people begin to leave for Thanksgiving break.

Do you have the time and resources to plan and host an event at this time? Note: To plan and host an event with the Programming team you will need to commit to 5-10 working hours a week. 
Yes
No
Approximately how large will the planning team be?
15-20

How many people (approximately) will be able to help out with the event day of?
15-20

What services or resources could you offer to the event? Performance, activity, etc
At our proposed event, we can offer both a salsa/bachata performance by our performance team and an activity such as salsa/bachata lessons for attendees.

Please state how you would like your groups name and information presented for marketing purposes.
Group name: Salsa at Cal
Information: Social dancing and Latin cultural club on campus

Please upload your logo to be used for marketing purposes. *Note we will only use if chosen for a sponsorship.

Which month would you be able to host an event?
November
Do you have an event in mind you would like to host in the union? If so, include details, date, time, etc
We would like to host a Latin social dancing event for students to be introduced to this beautiful expression of Latine culture. It would ideally take place in the evening, perhaps from 6-10 PM on Thursday November 9th. We would begin the event with one hour of salsa/bachata lessons hosted by our very own teaching team, followed by a never-before-seen performance from our club performance team. After the performance, we will open up the floor to social dancing for the remainder of the evening, with our team spread out throughout the floor dancing with attendees as well. Ideally the event would provide refreshments such as chips, salsa, aguas frescas, and more.

Do you agree to the following Terms and Conditions? 
-RSO must assign a main point of contact for the event planning that is able to make the final call on decisions. 
-If RSO must remove themselves from the sponsorship then they must inform the Programming Coordinator 1 month before the scheduled event so that another group can be selected. Note this may disqualify the RSO from being approved for future sponsorship opportunities. 
-The RSO agrees to keep communication open with the Programming Coordinator and attends regular planning meetings.
-RSO agrees to actively participate in the planning and if RSO does not attend planning meetings or complete assigned tasks by due dates then the group risks being removed from the sponsorship program.
Yes

Course Description
This salsa class explores the cultural, historical, and social underpinnings of salsa dancing through various sources: presentations, readings, dance, and events. The course aims to help students be competent at dancing salsa and learn about its place in society. Students will not be graded on dance ability.

Objectives:
Understand the history and culture of salsa and other social dances.
Understand social dancing in relation to contemporary society (e.g. gender roles, rebellion, etc).


Course Format: One-hour practice accompanied with online material and discussion
Dance! The dance instruction part of each class will be a series taught by the course facilitators and occasional guest instructors. Beginner and intermediate students are taught separately. Beginners who have little or no previous dance experience will be introduced to salsa dancing. Intermediate students will put to practice the fundamental basic steps of salsa dance as well as dive deeper into understanding the basics and their variations.
Through short readings, videos, and discussions, students will learn about a variety of topics related to dance as a medium for social interaction between individuals and groups of people. 

Course Overview/Grading:
To pass the class, you must complete the following:
Attendance (35% of final grade): 
Have at most 2 absences. (3 tardies = 1 absence)
Arrival 10 minutes late (past berkeley time) = tardy
Arrival 30 minutes late (past berkeley time) = absence
Excused Absences are permitted; Please notify DeCal team beforehand via email (salsaatcal@berkeley.edu)
Class participation is crucial for the lesson portion of the class.

Write-Ups and Participation (5 points each = 15%) :
Complete 2 Write-Ups. Each student must write a 1-page response to a salsa social dance event they attended during the semester of taking the DeCal and a 1-page response about the Dirty Dancing Havana Nights movie.
Salsa event experience (On or off campus)
This includes at least two hours of dancing, whether at our events or off-campus. The goal of this is to further introduce students to the art of Latin dance and learn about its culture. If you are unable to attend any events, contact instructors for alternative assignments.
Dirty Dancing Havana Nights movie
Access to the movie will be provided by DeCal team

Final Presentations (50% of final grade):	
Complete the Final Project for your section.
Beginners will get into pairs and record a 60 seconds to 1 minute video showing the learned moves plus one new move. OR a 45 second LIVE performance.
Intermediates will also get into pairs and choreograph in front of class a 2 minute dance (including styling, footwork, new moves and a lot of flavor!)

Occasional reading assignments.
Excerpts from the following texts will be included in weekly reading assignments, lectures, and discussions. The list below is subject to change; all readings will be made available via Bcourses.

March 17th reservation, change?
Reserve Anna Head for spring formal?
External affairs:
	Babi:
10-15% off: $2/item + screenprinting (Bay Area Custom Shirts); the more we have the less the piece will be, $5/item on orders of 12-36 times (est.)
We need to gather what kind and how many items, placement of brand, shirt/ink color, etc. Screen setups are charged everywhere, but the price may drop if we go back for more items with the same logo.
We can buy merchandise from the screen printing company, or buy our own elsewhere, and then use someone else’s printing. 
fernando@bayareacustomshirts.com
What’s our budget and what kind of designs are we leaning towards? Merch that we wanna settle on?
Bandanas, sweat towels, sweats, shirts, hoodies, hats?
I hit up @bsidebrujas and @chulitavinyclub on IG about past venues they’ve been at in the Bay area. There’s La Reyna bakery, but that’s in the mission. It is very close to http://www.missionculturalcenter.org/index.html which is another venue I think would be a cool place to hold lessons and social dancing. If we wanna stay in east bay, I’d really like to setup shop in Latinx-owned businesses, so hopefully they get back to me soon about spaces they’ve liked in the past. Maybe we could do a mixer with the vinyl groups, like mashing up OG salsa tunes and the oldies lowriders they play.
I will check previous sponsors later today or tomorrow. 
	Questions/ comments:
Have you found any outside venues we can host an event at?
Maybe look for a company to sponsor an event? Look at our previous email, we had a couple offers in the past.
Publicity: 
	Alie: asked other club about where we got tshirts if we still havent found a place to do it. 
Looks pretty good - https://www.4imprint.com/tag/97/T-Shirts

Members will be invited to submit a written application for the position, which the existing officers will review as a group. They will then offer interviews to the applicants of their choice and select a new officer from them. 

Unless circumstances are extenuating, new officer selection will be done at the beginning each semester, following which the outgoing officers will train their replacements for the remainder of the semester, and the new officers will begin their terms the following semester. An officer may be removed from office by a two-thirds majority vote of the executive committee, or by a two-thirds majority vote of the active members. Members must be notified at least two weeks in advance of such a vote.
ARTICLE VII : Meetings
The board members and any active members who wish to attend will meet weekly to plan events and discuss club issues. The President will call the meetings.

Meeting times will be decided by consensus among the officers and/or active members, and members will be notified via email of the time and location of each meeting. There will not be a call for special emergency meetings. 
ARTICLE VIII : Constitutional Amendments
A constitutional amendment may be proposed by any active member and should be presented at a meeting in writing. If a member wishes to propose an amendment at a meeting, he or she should notify the officers, who will then notify the members via email. Members must be notified of a vote on an amendment at least two weeks before the vote is to be held. An amendment, addition, or deletion requires a two-thirds majority vote by the active members in order to pass. All amendments, additions or deletions to this document must be filed with the LEAD Center in 102 Hearst Gym.
ARTICLE IX : Dissolution
A two-thirds majority of the active members may vote to dissolve the group. Members must be notified via email at least two weeks before such a vote is held.

After 5 or more years of inactivity, any privately obtained funds left in accounts will be donated to the ASUC carry forward account.
