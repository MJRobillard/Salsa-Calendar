They will then offer interviews to the applicants of their choice and select a new officer from them. 

Unless circumstances are extenuating, new officer selection will be done at the beginning each semester, following which the outgoing officers will train their replacements for the remainder of the semester, and the new officers will begin their terms the following semester. An officer may be removed from office by a two-thirds majority vote of the executive committee, or by a two-thirds majority vote of the active members. Members must be notified at least two weeks in advance of such a vote.

ARTICLE VIII : Constitutional Amendments
A constitutional amendment may be proposed by any active member and should be presented at a meeting in writing. If a member wishes to propose an amendment at a meeting, he or she should notify the officers, who will then notify the members via email. Members must be notified of a vote on an amendment at least two weeks before the vote is to be held. An amendment, addition, or deletion requires a two-thirds majority vote by the active members in order to pass. All amendments, additions or deletions to this document must be filed with the LEAD Center in 102 Hearst Gym.
ARTICLE IX : Dissolution
A two-thirds majority of the active members may vote to dissolve the group. Members must be notified via email at least two weeks before such a vote is held.
