The Academic Section:

3.) Bearing in mind that we MUST give you assignments in order to give you one unit of credit, what do you think about the writing we’ve asked you to do? Anything we could do differently?









4.) Do you have any further suggestions, comments, criticisms? 








The Dance Section:
Circle one of each: 	I am a leader / follower in the beginner / intermediate class.

3.) What do you think your instructors do well? Are there any particular features of the dance class that you enjoy or think they do that is particularly helpful? Why?





4.) What do you think your instructors should do differently? Are there any things they taught you or asked you to do that you thought were especially unhelpful?


 



5.) Are there any particular things you want your instructors to teach you? This can be a particular salsa step, or style.





6.) What do you think about the goals? Do you think your instructors are helping you accomplish them? 






7.) Do you have any further suggestions, comments, criticisms? 





Overall:
How do you feel about the overall direction of the course so far? Do you have anything else you would like us to know?

Supporting Faculty Member (Name and Contact Info): 
Mary E Kelsey
mkelsey@berkeley.edu

Event: (Title, date, location)
Salsaween, October 27, 2017, Hearst Gym
 
Amount requested:
 
Brief description of the event: This is a free event where we teach students the Salsa basics and provide them with a social environment in which they can practice these skills.
 
Who will be attending the event? How many will be attending? Why are they attending?
 
Both undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in Latin dancing attend our events. While students are usually intimidated by the prospect of social dancing, we’ve managed to create a welcoming environment for all dance levels by providing lessons at the beginning of our events. This allows all students to participate at some level.  On average 150 people attend the event.
 
 
How would you advertise/market this event? Is this an existing event that happens every year or semester? If so, please describe the success the event has had in the past.
 
This event has been held every fall semester and has been very successful, with an average of 150 people attending every year.  In order to advertise this event we use a combination of social media and traditional flyering. We advertise our event on Facebook at least once a week and currently have around 400 people interested in this years event. We also announce the event to students in the Decal and those who attend our weekly event, Salsa on Sproul. Leading up to the event we also increase the amount of days we flyer on sproul; flyering around 2-3 days per week.
 
 
Why do you deserve a grant from the Arts and Creativity Fund? Describe how your event will promote artistic endeavors at UC Berkeley.
 
We deserve a grant from the Arts and Creativity Fund because we provide a safe and inclusive space for all students to express themselves through dance.
 
Our event promotes artistic endeavors at UC Berkeley by exposing students to different types of dance outside of their culture. We simultaneously provide Latinx/Chicanx students with an environment in which they can feel and be themselves.
 
Please upload a detailed, itemized budget (including other sources of funding and all expenses).

Total: $305
We can ask for up to $500 so I added the decorations so we could ask for more money, add anything that’s somewhat reasonable (I don’t think the fog machine is reasonable but wasn’t sure what else to put…) 
 
dj: $150 for the night (let’s pretend we pay dhru lol)

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights did a very wonderful job at portraying the hostility between Americans and Cubans during the Cuban Revolution. Furthermore, It successfully counters such preconceived hostility and racism between the two nations with the relationship between our two main characters, Katey Miller and Javier; one American and one Cuban. However, I find several details in the movie cliche and could have been illustrated in a much more realistic and interesting way. For example, Having only been exposed to Cuban culture and its people for a very short period of time,  Katey empathizes and falls in love with Javier rather quickly. The process of Katey getting to know Javier and eventually falling in love with him through dancing could have been conveyed through a much more interesting and captivating way.
	Overall,  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights successfully explores the duality of blind hatred and innocent love between people from two opposing nations. Nevertheless, the innocent love between Katey and Javier  and the connection they felt from dancing with each other could have been portrayed in a much better way by the director, Guy Ferland. The dancing scenes was not very outstanding compared to a normal scene even though it is a movie about dancing. The camera often zooms out and fails to capture their beautiful movements and close connections. Guy Ferland chooses to portray dancing through a cliche lense and fails to capture my attention because of that. Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights has a plot with enormous potential but the director failed to realize.

	The movie Dirty Dancing has to main characters who are “Javier” and “Katye”. This movie takes place in cuba while the country is in the middle of a revolution. It was very interesting to see how to completely different people were able to like each other and be able to put there love into dancing with a passion.
	This movie was actually really good in my opinion. I really liked about the movie how funny it was. There were so many funny moments in the movie that made me laugh hard. I also liked how they used two different people with totally different lives to be able to get to know each other and eventually fall in love. I did not like how white people were portrayed in the movie. White people were made seen as the ones that had ultimate power.
	My favorite part of the movie was when Javier and Katye started to practice for the contest and they were starting to like each other. It was beautiful to see 2 different people fall in love, whom they had the same passion of dancing. Seeing them dance at the end with all of that passion, having that bonding with each other, moving along the floor with the flawless connection was just great to see.
	I feel like I relate to Javier in a lot of small or big aspects. Javier is from Cuba and I’m from Mexico. Javier started working from a small age and I did as well. I had my first job when I was 8 years old in Mexico and I also worked fixing cars. Javier was a big part of his family and he was basically the man of the house. For me it was almost the same as well. My dad would leave to work at three in the morning and before he would leave he would wake me up and tell me that when he was gone i was the man of the house.

Katelyn Perez-Lorenz 
Dirty Dancing Havana Nightz 
	Much like its counterpart, Dirty Dancing Havana Nightz consists of a love story built on the foundation of dance, but instead of opposition only from class disputes the Havana Nightz version shows the racism between white Americans and the Cuban population. What I really appreciated about this version of Dirty Dancing was that it focused on the dispute between the Cubans and the Americans that were practically taking over Cuba and building hotels and casinos that paid the corrupt representatives of Cuba. I was intrigued to see how the dancing was ingrained in the soul of the Cuba. The movie took place in an extremely tumultuous political time in the history of Cuba. The leaders of the country were corrupt and funneling money into their pockets instead of making job opportunities for the population. There was extreme military intervention to prevent an uprising, they burned books, kidnapped people form their own homes, and allowed the Americans to profit off of the land while corrupting the lower class.   
One of the bigger downfalls of the movie was how minimal the character development was. It is hard to believe the love scenes because we did not know the characters that well. When there was character development the scenes seemed rushed. I understand that the was a lower budget movie and that was probably why some of the scenes felt rushed. 
Overall, I liked the movie. It was a cute typical love story with a better back story than the original. The dancing scenes were my favorite (even more than the original movie) they had amazing chemistry and I loved the interactions with the lead characters when first starting to dance together. I was surprised to see Patrick Swayze in the movie.

Gregoria Millensifer
	Rebellion, dancing, romance, heartbreak, drama.  How could anyone not enjoy the movie Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights?  The movie not only showcases amazing latin dance but the struggles in the life of an average, young Cuban man during the Cuban Revolution and the process of a young, American woman fully understanding and appreciating dance.  My favorite elements about this movie were the exposures of cultural differences and elaboration of latin dancing.
As Katey learns to dance, she has to overcome the awkwardness of letting her body move freely, then do it in front of others, and then do it while a guy is touching and leading her body; something that everyone must do to learn latin dance.  Javier helps her in this while in his own personal life, he supports his family and faces the struggles of the cuban revolution with his community and his family.  I love how the movie captures both these very different struggles in two very different people but brings them together anyways.
As a Chicana who grew up in San Diego, I have experienced and observed both sides of latino and non-latino reactions to latin dancing.  I have noticed that many non-latinos or anyone who did not grow up around dance around them feel that latin dancing is a form of dirty dancing because it involves being close to your partner and ultimately freeing your body in dance.  To latinos or anyone who grew up around dance, however, latin dance is a delicacy, an art, and the way to happiness; it is everything good.  Latin dancing is one of the main ways, and my favorite besides food, that latinos get together to celebrate their culture, life, and happiness.  The difference in these views is portrayed very well in this movie through how Javier and other dancers in the movie explain latin dancing to Katey as an art compared to how Katey’s parents and others from the country club react in an appalling way towards the latin dancing.
