I went with my girlfriend to this event called Orquesta La Farandula Live at Soho on October 20th in Santa Barbara, CA. It was my 1st time seeing my girlfriend since the start of the class, so I tried to teach her a lot of the moves we learned in class before the event. We got there and there was 2 dance floors to choose from, a salsa dance floor and a bachata dance floor. We 1st decided to go to the bachata dance floor as that one was closer to the door and there were less people dancing on it. It was interesting to see that some people were just there to sit at the tables around the dance floors and just sit and chat. Some people didn‚Äôt actually dance with someone all night. The crowd of people there a bit older and didn‚Äôt seem of college age. As such there were a lot of experienced couples the dance floor. I tried to learn some of the moves they were doing and learned a few new moves from watching them. The alcohol was flowing, so I found it a bit easier to just lose myself in the dancing and tried to not focus on counting steps, but rather just trying to learn how to lead. We went over to the salsa floor, but it was a lot more packed and the dance floor was bigger. It seemed like the event was mostly people who wanted to dance salsa and only a handful of bachateros. The salsa side seemed a bit more lively with people dancing multiple styles. We spent most of the night on the dance floor only taking a break for a margarita. That‚Äôs when I really started to people watch and noticed the scene. There was a salsa performance that was pretty interesting, but sadly we were a little bit too far back to really get the full effect of the music. The most fun part was being able to see what people are doing and be able to break it down into steps counts. That is something I think i learned in the Decal that really comes in handy when out social dancing. After we left the event we took asked someone to take a picture, who turned out to be one of the birthdays that were being celebrated at this event! All in all it was a pretty fun event. Here‚Äôs the picture

Gabby Cheung
The day leading up to my first salsa social event, I was a nervous wreck. I had only been in the beginners decal for a couple weeks! How would I be able to follow more advanced dancers who knew moves I had never even heard of? Why would anyone want to dance with someone who can only do the LA basic step and a J-turn? When I actually arrived to Gio‚Äôs and got the first lesson out of the way, my entire attitude flipped. I had no idea how fun social dancing could be, no matter what level dancer you are.
	I didn‚Äôt expect there to be such a wide variety of leading styles. It was really interesting to try and catch on to a lead‚Äôs patterns and predict what move they would orchestrate next. When I danced with my fellow decal beginners, this was pretty easy to do; we all learned the same two or three turns and practiced them on repeat. The more seasoned dancers, on the other hand, were a challenge! It was like playing chess when you‚Äôve only ever played checkers. They would chain moves together so quickly that I couldn‚Äôt even remember what count I was on. I completely abandoned my footwork and just tried to spin when I they signaled.
One older man asked me to dance and I gladly accepted, thinking he would be more my speed. Little did I know, he was a salsa connoisseur! (Or at least, what I considered to be a connoisseur as a super-duper beginner). I probably had the most fun of all dancing with him, because it was the first time I really noticed the difference in leading style. After that dance, I focused a lot on keeping my steps small and staying on my toes in order to follow each lead better. Even when dancing bachata‚Äîwhich I hadn‚Äôt done before‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt too difficult to follow when I thought less about the counts and more about matching the leads. 
Although I have learned a lot more salsa moves since then, I still think that social dancing at Gio‚Äôs was the best (and most fun) way to improve my salsa dancing.

Our Dances

Salsa
History	

	From Wikipedia:

The name "salsa" has been described as the dance since the mid-1970s. The use of the term for the dance started in New York. It evolved from earlier Cuban dance forms such as Son, Son Montuno, Cha cha cha and Mambo which were popular in the Caribbean, Latin America and the Latino communities in New York since the 1940s. Salsa, like most music genres has gone through a lot of variation through the years and incorporated elements of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Caribbean dances such as Guaguanco and Pachanga. Different countries of the Caribbean and Latin America have distinct salsa styles of their own, such as Cuban, Colombian, Puerto Rican and New York styles.
There is some controversy surrounding the origins of the word salsa. Some claim that it was based on a cry shouted by musicians while they were playing their music. Others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music, who chose the word "salsa" because of its spicy and hot connotations. Still others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles, just like salsa or "sauce" in Latin American countries is a mixture of different ingredients.
	Our Salsa

Salsa@Cal offers many ways for you to learn and improve your salsa skills
 Our DeCal has a beginner and an intermediate section that allows you to learn and practice in an organized fashion from our dedicated student instructors. The DeCal is held each semester and involves and application process due to high student demand.

STARTING UP THE DECAL: semesterly basis
Paperwork: You will want to be in touch with Rebecca Chavez (rebeccaisme@berkeley.edu), who handles our paperwork.
http://www.decal.org/start-a-course/seven-steps/ This is useful, but starting last semester, the paperwork for the Spring 2012 semester has changed, and this is the link: http://vpapf.chance.berkeley.edu/specialstudies/Course_Proposal_Packet.pdf
Some tips: 
we offer both the 98 and 198 course  
instructor of record name: Mary Kelsey (mkelsey@berkeley.edu)
The first four questions should be on the syllabus (which you should revise each semester to fit these requirements ‚Äì I‚Äôve already revised it to fit Spring 2012 ‚Äì or at least change the date so the DeCal board thinks we‚Äôve been making changes)
Question 5 will require an answer on a separate page
In addition to this sheet, you will also need to fill out the second page of the Independent Study Application (already uploaded in the gdoc folder under School Forms). This is the breakdown:
Class time: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Reading: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Presentations: 10 hrs/presentation x 1 presentation
Writing: 2.5 hrs/journal x 2 journals
IF the required amount of hours for a unit changes, make changes accordingly!
You will also need to submit the syllabus (also uploaded under school forms, entitled Salsa Syllabus F11 v2)
Make sure you get Mary Kelsey (454 Barrows) to sign everything!
Submit the forms to Rebecca, who is next door to Mary (door to the left).
Rebecca will most likely give the paperwork herself to the DeCal board, but just in case, make 2ish copies for yourselves in case somebody needs it and Rebecca has the paperwork.
If she asks, 30 is the target enrollment
Do NOT ask for CECs, open CCNs are fine
Difference: open CCNs mean you just give those who make it into the decal the different CCNs (one for the 98, another for 198) and CECs means each person has an entry code and is a huge hassle, especially if one drops or whatever.
Room scheduling:
Rebecca will give you a 30-person room. KEEP THIS ROOM, as if the campus room scheduling falls through, you will need this room.
You should also reserve a room as a student group. The bigger the possible‚Ä¶ You know the drill. 
Arcy, you said you might be able to do this via caucus? This would be grand, because you know how we have many problems doing this.
The online form is at http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/studentgrps.html 
This is on a first-come, first-served basis so this must be done quickly!
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS IN THE FALL SEMESTER, make sure there are 4 signatories prior to this because all clubs have to be revalidated before the academic year starts.
For the room in Hearst Gym, contact Brent Atkinson. His email is brentuc@berkeley.edu and his phone number is 510-643-0604. Email him first ‚ÄìKevin says he is slow to respond, but he responded within 9ish days for me‚Äîbut if he doesn‚Äôt respond, email again. And if he doesn‚Äôt respond then, call him.
Say that the salsa DECAL (and not club) needs Hearst Gym, but we will actually be using it for Tuesday classes, so tell him you want it on Tuesdays. This is the template I used when emailing him:
Hi Brent,

I am the new facilitator of the Salsa Dance DeCal this coming year(semester). We‚Äôll be doing the DeCal once again in the Fall(Spring), and would like to use Hearst. Our top choices would be 8-10pm on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. Please let me know if this would work. Thanks for your help!

Sincerely,
Jenna Hang
Email him early on ‚Äì now would be the opportune time.
He may ask for a copy of the DeCal paperwork ‚Äì if so, give him a copy.
Eshelman Space Allocation: turn in the paperwork before the end of April (end of spring semester) to have a space for the following academic year.
DeCal website: The DeCal board will send you information regarding how to access the website in the fall.
Since this is the spring semester, you may have to log in with my info from last semester ‚Äì if this is the case, the information is
Login: jenna.hang@berkeley.edu
pw: 6a4b8f4be
Admissions Process
Set up an application using Google Forms ‚Äì this will have a form like one you usually see, but all the information will come into the Google Excel doc. This is the doc you see when we read the apps. Just use the same questions as years previous, but if you would like to, make up your own.
Come time to choose who is in the DeCal, cap it at 24 students; 12 leads and 12 followers. This leaves room for 6 more students to be on the waitlist (3 leads and 3 follows). This was complicated last year because we did not leave room for a waitlist.
BE ON TOP OF YOUR EMAILS at this time. Once you have determined who will be on what, give them the CCNs. They are in the email from Rebecca that I forwarded to each of you.
Don‚Äôt start too early. We started everything within the first two weeks of class, and this is bad timing ‚Äì people are still unsure if they can stay in the DeCal. Hold the first day of class (which is really the info session) about the third week of school, and then have applications due a week later. This gives people time to hear about the club and we don‚Äôt have to scramble holding 3 different info sessions. I also foresee less drops from the accepted applicants if we do it this way.
Once the DeCal has started, the assignments and everything have already been uploaded. Kevin also has a doc filled with the emails he sent out each week ‚Äì I used them, made a few changes, so plan accordingly. I have added the email I sent out for the different styles of salsa lecture that we had this semester ‚Äì it is up to you if you would like to keep that topic or change it.
Send out the history of salsa reading/syllabus before the first official day of class. They should have already read everything before the first day, so that they are ready for the lecture.
Make a decal list-serve if you‚Äôd like. I did it because I was too lazy to input 30 emails every time I sent an email. Make sure to CC the other coords though so they know what‚Äôs up.
STARTING UP/MAINTAINING THE CLUB
Cal Day is nice, but I don‚Äôt think it is a big concern because they are prospective students. We get most of our members from Calapalooza in the fall semester.
I don‚Äôt know if this is a yearly thing, but I had to revise the constitution and turn it in at the end of the year last year, but it may have been because we had changed our name from Social Ballroom Club to Salsa Dance at Cal, and then to just Salsa Dance.
CHECK ON THIS, because this is a hazy area for me.
The constitution should be uploaded already.
