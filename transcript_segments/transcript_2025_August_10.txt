Timestamp: 2025-08-17 01:07:06.566196
--------------------
DeCal Schedule Spring 2025 
Location: Hearst Gym 242
Beginner Class: 4-5 PM 
Intermediate Section: 5-6 PM 
Open Practica: Tuesdays 8:30-10 PM by the Social Sciences Building

When requested, DeCal Salsistants will receive 1-2 units P/NP if they can meet these attendance commitments and responsibilities. Below we will be outlining DeCal Salsistant responsibilities. Please take your time to review them before showing up to class!
Attendance Policy 
Salsistants are expected to show up to every section they committed to on their application for the entirety of the semester. We will allow up to 3 absences (1 unexcused absence; 2 with 24-hour prior notice) 
Salsistants are expected to show up on time to their sections, and to stay for the entirety of their sections
**Salsistants who noted availability for both beginner and intermediate, but who can only attend 1 section, will be assigned a section. When possible, preference will be considered, but ultimately sections will be assigned to even out the number of facilitators.**  
In-Class/Open Practica Responsibilities 
Expected to know how to dance both (at least basics) the Lead and Follow + volunteer for either role as needed
Look out for students who may need additional help while the instructors are answering questions.
Ask GUIDING QUESTIONS: When you realize a student is struggling, ask the instructors a guiding question that may be useful for the student. Especially important/useful for the beginner section.
If pairs are even, Salsistants will not sit out, but pair up and jump into the circle. 
The purpose of this is so that when a switch happens, students are able to dance with experienced dancers (aka you!) and get a feel for the proper communication they should be receiving (aka good tension, proper hand placements, etc) and get one-on-one feedback...Plus, this way you can practice too!  
Assist in Warm Up demonstration. Able to substitute for an instructor (Lead or Follow).
Salsistants have the responsibility of helping students perform/record their Final Performances if unexpected complications arise (ex: their partner sprains an ankle and a lead/follow needs to step in). However your role is limited to helping them learn the moves rather than giving them ideas and choreography tips, as it should be based on their own creativity
Lastly, 
Salsistants must keep a professional attitude during class times (ex: DO NOT hit on the person you’re helping out during class times; Do not disrupt the class; Please be courteous to instructors when they are teaching/speaking.) 
Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet 
Please review the Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet if you have any questions, concerns, or already know of planned absences so we can update the schedule accordingly.
Enrollment 
If you requested units, you should be enrolled on CalCentral If you enroll for units, you are required to consistently abide by the Responsibilities & Attendance Policy, whether you are only participating in one section per week or multiple. 
Communication 
Please join the DeCal Salsistant groupchat for updates ASAP!!

Thank you for your commitment & enthusiasm towards the DeCal. We appreciate your presence and look forward to welcoming you into the DeCal Squad!!

DeCal Instructors Guide

Description: 
The goal of this position is to teach the students about the history and culture of salsa dancing and music. Music evolves in many ways throughout generations but we are here to emphasize where salsa came from to not let the knowledge die. The salsa dancing we are teaching is LA style and is very different from the original. We teach on “the one” and focus on structure/form. We also avoid gender roles and promote respect and consent. Make sure to emphasize that anyone can be in the position of a follow or lead. And MOST IMPORTANTLY you MUST include a lesson on respect and consent. 
Being in the Instructor role puts you in a position of leadership. People will look up to you so be welcoming and respectful to your students. Make clear to them that if they are ever uncomfortable they should reach out to you for accommodations. Be in communication with your salsistants. And if you see something, say something. 

Other than class time, you are responsible for showing up to Open Practica. 
If there is ever a time where you can not go to class or Open Practica, communicate with fellow instructors.  

Responsibilities:
Take attendance 
Set classroom expectations
Set a lesson plan for the week 
Publish Modules/Assignments 
Announce assignments 
Pair randomly for final performances

{2023 Fall} Student Union RSO Sponsorship Application
The Student Union Programming team brings events and activities to the Student Union for student engagement and development. We have hosted the Boba Welcome Back Social, Bridgerton Tea Party, De-Stress Fest and many more!

The Programming team will partner with RSOs to host/ fund 2-3 large scale events (100+ guests) within the Student Union per semester for student engagement and RSO exposure. Fall 2023 will be the pilot phase therefore we will likely only host one event in October or November.
Along with the sponsorship, the Programming team will also assist in planning the event and offer professional event planning services and marketing for the event. Depending on the nature of the event, the Programming team may recommend that several RSOs collaborate to host one single event. The Student Union will offer up to $5,000 in sponsorship per event.
To apply please fill out the application below by September 26th at noon.  If chosen, the Programming team will contact the group via email by September 29th for further steps.

Tell us about your organization
Salsa at Cal is a group of university students who would like to spread their appreciation and knowledge of Salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus. We host social dancing events and classes, trips to local clubs, and FREE classes in Salsa and other styles. We also host a DeCal named “History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance” each semester. We've taught everything from Rueda Cubana, Merengue, and Bachata, but our main focus is on Salsa.

How long has your RSO been on campus?
Since 2009

How many members do you have?
Varies; usually from 10-30 per semester 

Please describe the event (theme, activities you are interested in, etc.) 
A Latin social dancing and dance lessons event coupled with a featured performance of these dances by our performance team. A potential name for our event could be Salsa Posada. 

What goals do you anticipate your event will accomplish? Please list 2-3.
We anticipate our proposed event to accomplish facilitating easier access to a common cultural activity, providing a space for the Cal Latine community to come together through one facet of our complex and multi-faceted culture, and to expand the cultural horizons of Cal students by sharing our knowledge of and passion for dance with them. 
We anticipate our event will facilitate access to a common cultural activity
provide a space for the Cal Latine community to come together Our event will teach 

Why are you interested in hosting an event with the Student Union Programming team?
As social dancers ourselves, while there are many opportunities to social dance in Berkeley and the East Bay, we understand that new learners may not feel as comfortable social dancing in these environments with people of all ages and levels of experience. Through an event hosted in conjunction with the Student Union Programming team, we hope to create a space in which beginners and experienced dancers alike can come together and dance with members of their own age group and school community, and learn more about one facet of Latine culture in doing so!

How do you plan to market the event?
Instagram, Facebook, newsletter/mailing list, digital flyers, etc.

Please share your social media profiles (facebook, instagram, etc)
Instagram: @salsaatcalberkeley; Facebook: @salsaatcalberkeley

Have you hosted any events on campus?
Yes

If yes, tell us about what you have hosted before below:
We have hosted multiple community-wide social dancing events in the past year, hosted at Spats in Downtown Berkeley, including Salsaween and Salsa Tropical. Each of these events had gross profits of between $1500 and $2000, with turnouts in the 100s, which we considered to be highly successful considering the capacity of Spats’ event space. As for events on campus that we’ve hosted, pre-pandemic the club has hosted community-wide lessons and events called Open Practicas in which members of the community would be invited to learn to dance alongside students and we would play music on Sproul Plaza so people could put the moves they had learned to work.

If applicable, what is your ideal Student Union location and date for your event? Note: We cannot guarantee the location and date; however, this information is a helpful starting point for planning. 
We were thinking of using the Pauley Ballroom on Thursday, November 9th, since the space is perfect for dancing and has a stage for elevated and more easily visible teaching. As for the date, we thought this would be easily accessible to students because it’s before the holiday weekend and before people begin to leave for Thanksgiving break.

Do you have the time and resources to plan and host an event at this time? Note: To plan and host an event with the Programming team you will need to commit to 5-10 working hours a week. 
Yes
No
Approximately how large will the planning team be?
15-20

How many people (approximately) will be able to help out with the event day of?
15-20

What services or resources could you offer to the event? Performance, activity, etc
At our proposed event, we can offer both a salsa/bachata performance by our performance team and an activity such as salsa/bachata lessons for attendees.

Please state how you would like your groups name and information presented for marketing purposes.
Group name: Salsa at Cal
Information: Social dancing and Latin cultural club on campus

Please upload your logo to be used for marketing purposes. *Note we will only use if chosen for a sponsorship.

Which month would you be able to host an event?
November
Do you have an event in mind you would like to host in the union? If so, include details, date, time, etc
We would like to host a Latin social dancing event for students to be introduced to this beautiful expression of Latine culture. It would ideally take place in the evening, perhaps from 6-10 PM on Thursday November 9th. We would begin the event with one hour of salsa/bachata lessons hosted by our very own teaching team, followed by a never-before-seen performance from our club performance team. After the performance, we will open up the floor to social dancing for the remainder of the evening, with our team spread out throughout the floor dancing with attendees as well. Ideally the event would provide refreshments such as chips, salsa, aguas frescas, and more.

Do you agree to the following Terms and Conditions? 
-RSO must assign a main point of contact for the event planning that is able to make the final call on decisions. 
-If RSO must remove themselves from the sponsorship then they must inform the Programming Coordinator 1 month before the scheduled event so that another group can be selected. Note this may disqualify the RSO from being approved for future sponsorship opportunities. 
-The RSO agrees to keep communication open with the Programming Coordinator and attends regular planning meetings.
-RSO agrees to actively participate in the planning and if RSO does not attend planning meetings or complete assigned tasks by due dates then the group risks being removed from the sponsorship program.
Yes

Course Description
This salsa class explores the cultural, historical, and social underpinnings of salsa dancing through various sources: presentations, readings, dance, and events. The course aims to help students be competent at dancing salsa and learn about its place in society. Students will not be graded on dance ability.

Objectives:
Understand the history and culture of salsa and other social dances.
Understand social dancing in relation to contemporary society (e.g. gender roles, rebellion, etc).


Course Format: One-hour practice accompanied with online material and discussion
Dance! The dance instruction part of each class will be a series taught by the course facilitators and occasional guest instructors. Beginner and intermediate students are taught separately. Beginners who have little or no previous dance experience will be introduced to salsa dancing. Intermediate students will put to practice the fundamental basic steps of salsa dance as well as dive deeper into understanding the basics and their variations.
Through short readings, videos, and discussions, students will learn about a variety of topics related to dance as a medium for social interaction between individuals and groups of people. 

Course Overview/Grading:
To pass the class, you must complete the following:
Attendance (35% of final grade): 
Have at most 2 absences. (3 tardies = 1 absence)
Arrival 10 minutes late (past berkeley time) = tardy
Arrival 30 minutes late (past berkeley time) = absence
Excused Absences are permitted; Please notify DeCal team beforehand via email (salsaatcal@berkeley.edu)
Class participation is crucial for the lesson portion of the class.

Write-Ups and Participation (5 points each = 15%) :
Complete 2 Write-Ups. Each student must write a 1-page response to a salsa social dance event they attended during the semester of taking the DeCal and a 1-page response about the Dirty Dancing Havana Nights movie.
Salsa event experience (On or off campus)
This includes at least two hours of dancing, whether at our events or off-campus. The goal of this is to further introduce students to the art of Latin dance and learn about its culture. If you are unable to attend any events, contact instructors for alternative assignments.
Dirty Dancing Havana Nights movie
Access to the movie will be provided by DeCal team

Final Presentations (50% of final grade):	
Complete the Final Project for your section.
Beginners will get into pairs and record a 60 seconds to 1 minute video showing the learned moves plus one new move. OR a 45 second LIVE performance.
Intermediates will also get into pairs and choreograph in front of class a 2 minute dance (including styling, footwork, new moves and a lot of flavor!)

Occasional reading assignments.
Excerpts from the following texts will be included in weekly reading assignments, lectures, and discussions. The list below is subject to change; all readings will be made available via Bcourses.

March 17th reservation, change?
Reserve Anna Head for spring formal?
External affairs:
	Babi:
10-15% off: $2/item + screenprinting (Bay Area Custom Shirts); the more we have the less the piece will be, $5/item on orders of 12-36 times (est.)
We need to gather what kind and how many items, placement of brand, shirt/ink color, etc. Screen setups are charged everywhere, but the price may drop if we go back for more items with the same logo.
We can buy merchandise from the screen printing company, or buy our own elsewhere, and then use someone else’s printing. 
fernando@bayareacustomshirts.com
What’s our budget and what kind of designs are we leaning towards? Merch that we wanna settle on?
Bandanas, sweat towels, sweats, shirts, hoodies, hats?
I hit up @bsidebrujas and @chulitavinyclub on IG about past venues they’ve been at in the Bay area. There’s La Reyna bakery, but that’s in the mission. It is very close to http://www.missionculturalcenter.org/index.html which is another venue I think would be a cool place to hold lessons and social dancing. If we wanna stay in east bay, I’d really like to setup shop in Latinx-owned businesses, so hopefully they get back to me soon about spaces they’ve liked in the past. Maybe we could do a mixer with the vinyl groups, like mashing up OG salsa tunes and the oldies lowriders they play.
I will check previous sponsors later today or tomorrow. 
	Questions/ comments:
Have you found any outside venues we can host an event at?
Maybe look for a company to sponsor an event? Look at our previous email, we had a couple offers in the past.
Publicity: 
	Alie: asked other club about where we got tshirts if we still havent found a place to do it. 
Looks pretty good - https://www.4imprint.com/tag/97/T-Shirts
