--------------------
Hello to all the amazing people who applied to the History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance Decal for Fall 2021!

Thank you all for submitting your applications on time and for the patience you have had with our team this semester. It was an incredibly competitive semester and choosing between all your applications was very difficult. 

We informed everyone that the Salsa at Cal team would send out decision emails today. Because we have yet to find a space that accommodates us this semester, we ask for you all to remain patient until tomorrow when we have more concrete information on how many people, according to University standards, we can accept into the course. 

We are very sorry for this inconvenience but we promise to let you know more as soon as we can. 

Best,
Salsa at Cal

--------------------
DeCal Schedule Spring 2025 
Location: Hearst Gym 242
Beginner Class: 4-5 PM 
Intermediate Section: 5-6 PM 
Open Practica: Tuesdays 8:30-10 PM by the Social Sciences Building

When requested, DeCal Salsistants will receive 1-2 units P/NP if they can meet these attendance commitments and responsibilities. Below we will be outlining DeCal Salsistant responsibilities. Please take your time to review them before showing up to class!
Attendance Policy 
Salsistants are expected to show up to every section they committed to on their application for the entirety of the semester. We will allow up to 3 absences (1 unexcused absence; 2 with 24-hour prior notice) 
Salsistants are expected to show up on time to their sections, and to stay for the entirety of their sections
**Salsistants who noted availability for both beginner and intermediate, but who can only attend 1 section, will be assigned a section. When possible, preference will be considered, but ultimately sections will be assigned to even out the number of facilitators.**  
In-Class/Open Practica Responsibilities 
Expected to know how to dance both (at least basics) the Lead and Follow + volunteer for either role as needed
Look out for students who may need additional help while the instructors are answering questions.
Ask GUIDING QUESTIONS: When you realize a student is struggling, ask the instructors a guiding question that may be useful for the student. Especially important/useful for the beginner section.
If pairs are even, Salsistants will not sit out, but pair up and jump into the circle. 
The purpose of this is so that when a switch happens, students are able to dance with experienced dancers (aka you!) and get a feel for the proper communication they should be receiving (aka good tension, proper hand placements, etc) and get one-on-one feedback...Plus, this way you can practice too!  
Assist in Warm Up demonstration. Able to substitute for an instructor (Lead or Follow).
Salsistants have the responsibility of helping students perform/record their Final Performances if unexpected complications arise (ex: their partner sprains an ankle and a lead/follow needs to step in). However your role is limited to helping them learn the moves rather than giving them ideas and choreography tips, as it should be based on their own creativity
Lastly, 
Salsistants must keep a professional attitude during class times (ex: DO NOT hit on the person you’re helping out during class times; Do not disrupt the class; Please be courteous to instructors when they are teaching/speaking.) 
Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet 
Please review the Salsistant Schedule Spreadsheet if you have any questions, concerns, or already know of planned absences so we can update the schedule accordingly.
Enrollment 
If you requested units, you should be enrolled on CalCentral If you enroll for units, you are required to consistently abide by the Responsibilities & Attendance Policy, whether you are only participating in one section per week or multiple. 
Communication 
Please join the DeCal Salsistant groupchat for updates ASAP!!

Thank you for your commitment & enthusiasm towards the DeCal. We appreciate your presence and look forward to welcoming you into the DeCal Squad!!

DeCal Instructors Guide

Description: 
The goal of this position is to teach the students about the history and culture of salsa dancing and music. Music evolves in many ways throughout generations but we are here to emphasize where salsa came from to not let the knowledge die. The salsa dancing we are teaching is LA style and is very different from the original. We teach on “the one” and focus on structure/form. We also avoid gender roles and promote respect and consent. Make sure to emphasize that anyone can be in the position of a follow or lead. And MOST IMPORTANTLY you MUST include a lesson on respect and consent. 
Being in the Instructor role puts you in a position of leadership. People will look up to you so be welcoming and respectful to your students. Make clear to them that if they are ever uncomfortable they should reach out to you for accommodations. Be in communication with your salsistants. And if you see something, say something. 

Other than class time, you are responsible for showing up to Open Practica. 
If there is ever a time where you can not go to class or Open Practica, communicate with fellow instructors.  

Responsibilities:
Take attendance 
Set classroom expectations
Set a lesson plan for the week 
Publish Modules/Assignments 
Announce assignments 
Pair randomly for final performances

(To use in email/other formats to introduce us for events)

My name is ___, and I am the event coordinator for the famous Salsa @ Cal Club. We are the UC Berkeley-based club for Latin Dance enthusiasts and learners, with a main focus on salsa and bachata. I am reaching out to see if you would be interested in having us host our next salsa event at your location.

We are hoping to hold the event on (Friday, November 30th, from 9pm-1:45am). If this is not possible, we are also interested in the same time slot for (Saturday, December 1st). 

This event consists of an hour-long salsa and bachata lesson, followed by social dancing. We have a following of over 2,000 dancers, and are known for our DeCal salsa classes and on and off campus events. In the past have brought in over 200 people per event, and with the space provided by your location, can expect an even higher number. While we do have participants who are under age, there are also many over 21, so there will definitely be drink revenue from which your bar will benefit. We have our own DJ, who brings his own equipment and plays a variety of Latin Dance music.

For this particular event, we have a (Christmas Masquerade/Carnival) theme, where we will provide masks for participants and encourage them to dress up. We also hope to set up some decorations in the hour or so before the event.       (If needed, can include: Our pre-sale tickets are $10/person for the days prior to the day of the event, and $12 for the day of until 5pm. At the door ticket prices are $15.)

Thank you / Best,

File: /content/unzipped_files/Past Events/Hiring a DJ.docx
Timestamp: 2025-08-17 01:06:33.786453
--------------------
Guidelines to Hiring a DJ 

When hiring a DJ to come and play for one of Salsa at Cal’s parties, you need these requirements in order to have a successful party. 

The DJ is responsible for providing:
A good selection of danceable music for people to dance
Helps keep the experience dancers dancing throughout the party
Helps create a good atmosphere and brings energy to the party
Helps bring more people to come to future Salsa at Cal parties
Make any special announcements requested by the Salsa at Cal
Advertises for that particular Salsa at Cal’s party    
   
If the DJ meet these requirements, expect to have good turn out. In terms of paying a DJ, you need to evaluate the DJ through their experience, skill, and where they have play before, and what kind of music they normally play, and what kind of crowd they bring to the dance floor. We recommend to go listen to the DJ before contacting them to play for one of Salsa at Cal’s parties. Do not base your decision to hire a DJ solely through a friendship or doing a favor for them because this will affect Salsa at Cal reputation and future parties. 

How much you should pay a DJ:
$100 dollars = Decent
$125 dollars = Experience 
$150 dollars = Expert / Well known 

If the DJ is not doing his/her responsibilities, then you can deduct some money from what it was originally proposed to him / her. You can deduct –$25 dollars, if the DJ does one of the following things.

Ways to deduct money from the DJ:
He/She is not playing the music that we request or advertise in the event
He/She is dancing during the party or is not always in the DJ post during the party
He/She is letting a device play the music for the whole party
He/She promises to bring his / her DJ equipment, but fails do so
He/She damages Salsa at Cal’s DJ equipment 
He/She arrives 10 minutes late to the party
He/She fails to keep dancers to stay for the whole duration of the event or people start to leave the party

This section is intended to provide us with insight into what your organization's goals are and which cultural communities you support.
Multicultural Initiative Fund (MIF) Rubric
*this rubric is intended to guide the assessment and determination of funding levels for proposals submitted - NOTE that this rubric provides a framework for evaluation and funding decisions, and additional factors may be considered during the review process

Please describe your organization and its purpose (max 100 words)
Salsa at Cal is a group of university students who would like to spread their appreciation and knowledge of Salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus. We host social dancing events and classes, trips to local clubs, and FREE classes in Salsa and other styles. We also host a DeCal named “History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance” each semester. We've taught everything from Rueda Cubana, Merengue, and Bachata, but our main focus is on Salsa.

Does your organization or proposal receive funding from other avenues? If so, from where?
No, our organization has historically lacked funding.Initiative/Proposal

This section is intended to provide insight into how your organization would use any funds allocated to you from the MIF. This is the most important section, be thorough.
What is the intended outcome of your proposal/initiative in terms of its effect on a community? How does this proposal/initiative address a multicultural goal? (max 100 words)
As a club, we have always wanted to serve the broader underrepresented and marginalized community on campus. Our proposal is for an event called Salsa Prom. We have never done an event this big due to a lack of resources and funding. We hope that this on-campus event can bring salsa and bachata lovers to one single space where their diverse backgrounds are celebrated through dance and music.

What amount are you applying for? (ex: $1,000)
$5,000+

Have you applied to MIF before? If so, describe your experience. Put N/A if this is your first time applying.

Please answer each question in the rubric above!
Our intention with Salsa Prom and other future events is to cater to all student demographics regardless of cultural and ethnic background. 
Salsa Prom will serve all underrepresented student populations. At an institution as large as UC Berkeley, it can be a daunting task to discover communities and spaces that not only celebrate but openly receive those of familiar AND different cultural backgrounds. We recognize how intimate and cathartic it can be to share spaces with those who also identify with the same marginalized and oppressed experiences. As a result, we understand that most of our students 
We at Salsa at Cal appreciate that Berkeley will benefit from a rise in non-exclusive spaces that welcome members of diverse cultural backgrounds. We prioritize doing away with the exclusivity and all too-common gaps between different student organizations.  
YES. All events that Salsa at Cal hosts are aimed at recruitment and retention. We believe in the great importance of daily steps toward a larger body of students to be a part of our board and DeCal, or even just attend the many events we host!  



Please describe your organization and its purpose (max 400 words)

Founded in 2009, Salsa at Cal is a culturally diverse group of UC Berkeley students that strive to spread appreciation and awareness of the historical roots of Salsa and other Latin dances while engaging the local community. We teach a weekly DeCal titled “History, Culture, and Practice of Salsa Dance” each Fall and Spring semester. We host affordable social dances, trips to local clubs, and FREE instructional classes in Salsa and other styles. We’ve taught everything from Rueda Cubana, Merengue, Bachata, and - of course - traditional Salsa. Prior to Covid-19, Salsa at Cal would utilize campus resources (dance rooms located inside Hearst Gym and Eshleman Hall) to host low-stakes practice sessions for DeCal students and board members. However, in the wake of the Pandemic, we found ourselves in a financial situation where office hours needed to be reformatted from classroom spaces to becoming hosted in the tunnel near the Social Science Building as“Open Practica”. Most recently during the Fall 2024 semester, we’ve expanded our availability and knowledge to reach all students regardless of affiliation with the Salsa at Cal DeCal or board. 		





What is your intended initiative? Include some details on the scope ex: the number of attendees  (max 250 words)

As a club, we have always wanted to serve the underrepresented communities on campus. Our proposal is for an event called “Salsa Prom”. Salsa at Cal would not be able to host an event this large due to a lack of resources and funding. We hope that this on-campus event can bring Salsa and Bachata lovers to one single space where their diverse backgrounds are celebrated through dance and music. This event is being planned with the intention of attendance to be affordable, not exclusively for students of historically marginalized backgrounds, but the larger community of Berkeley. To host more events such as Salsa Prom, we will require updated speakers, camera and tripod, DJ equipment, microphones, and a tent that can be used for promotional purposes throughout campus. Open Practica and reservations for social dancing on Upper Sproul, for example, would benefit with the addition of the speakers and microphones we are budgeting for. The equipment that we will be purchasing is versatile for promotional purposes of Salsa Prom in addition to future events that won’t require extraneous amounts of funds.

What is the outcome of your proposal/initiative in terms of its effect on a community?

Our proposal aims to foster an inclusive community united through music and dance. Through “Salsa Prom”, we envision creating a vibrant space on campus where individuals from diverse backgrounds can come together to celebrate their love for Salsa and Bachata. We hope that this initiative will create an affordable and welcoming environment, not only for students, but also for the broader Berkeley community. This event is intended to bridge cultural gaps, highlight the diversity within our community, and celebrate the shared passion for Latin dance and music.

What amount are you applying for? (ex: $1,000)

$10,000

What is the minimum amount your organization can receive in order to complete your initiative? (ex: $1000)

$9,000

Have you applied to MIF before? If so, 

1. What years did your organization apply and how much funding was received 
And 2. Describe your experience with MIF. Put N/A if this is your first time applying.

We at Salsa at Cal previously applied to the MIF in the Spring 2024 semester. We were allocated a total of $5,000. 

If your event is a ticketed event how much money did you make last year? Were these funds used to break even? Please upload an image of this total amount. If your event is not ticketed, please respond with N/A.
For Salsa Prom 24’,  unfortunately we did not break even and our net profit was $-1154. The organizers of the event gave us a capacity restriction of 110 number of attendance, resulting in an additional obstacle for community access. We promoted a presale of $20 for students and $25 for General admission. On the day of the event, our prices are $25 per student and $30 for General admission. 


Does your organization or proposal receive funding from other avenues? If so, from where?

Yes, we have received our first wave of funding from the 2024-2025 ASUC Allocations and funding application. However, this amount is not a sufficient sum for Salsa at Cal to comfortably secure an adequate venue for Salsa Prom.
