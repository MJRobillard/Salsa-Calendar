Havana Nights
	Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was a very interesting film. It was an insightful experience to urban salsa during a very interesting time in world history. It showed us the complicated relationship between the US and Cuba and how people were often separated by race and nationality. However, it is incredibly important to note that the solution to this issue was dance. In the film, we saw our two protagonists fall in love and begin what can best be described as a romantic relationship. The two character quickly find out that all that keeps them apart ultimately does not matter due to their mutual love of music and dancing. The political message was a little out of place. Pro-Castro? No Thanks.
	I believe that this film does a lot in showing us the uniting power of music and dancing. Being a part of the salsa decal I have seen myself grow in a way that I had not before. It is important to state that I have been able to speak and bond with many people that I normally would not have. Apart from this I believe we can all agree that dancing has played an import role in culture and how people meet and interact. It is important for the healthy development of relationships in the presence of adversity. Through dance, we can hope to encourage a much more diverse world since we can have people from different backgrounds enjoy the same thing and this leads to a better world. I am thankful to have watched this film as it has changed my life and shown me the possibilities and how powerful dancing salsa is.

HOW TO: Make Good TinyURLs
Written 10.28.13 by André Crabb
It’s nice to make TinyUrls for documents in our Drive that we’d like to share with either students in the DeCal or the general public. Usually, its for the former.

Make the doc on Google Drive viewable by anyone with the link. NOT editable by anyone.
Copy the link.
Go to: http://tinyurl.com/
Paste the link in the ‘Long URL’ box.
If the doc/folder being shared is a general document (ie. Salsa Dance Locations):
Name the alias “Salsa_____” where “____” is what the doc is about.
ie. “SalsaLocations”
ie. “SalsaDeCalFinals”
Otherwise, if the doc/folder is specific to a semester (ie. DeCal Group sign-ups for Fall 2013)
Name the alias “SalsaDeCal____ ____” where “____” is what the doc is about, and the second “____” is the year & semester. This ensures succeeding semesters can follow the same format.
ie. “SalsaDeCalGroups13fall”
ie. “SalsaDeCalApplication14spring”
Add the new tiny URL to the document “Tinyurl Links” in our drive so we can keep track of it.
If possible, add a line “Viewable At: TINY_URL_HERE” in the document so anyone viewing it knows how to easily get there again.

	I thought the movie Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, while in the end a cheesy rom-com, had an interesting take on dancing as well as was able to incorporate the society and politics of Cuba. I liked how the movie constantly incorporated dance, and that there was a bigger plot beyond a love story. I like how they filmed the movie, such that the dancing scenes were dramaticized, such as when the young couple danced in time with the parents across the old timey film drop. 
	I think it was interesting how Cuban dance was portrayed. In all circumstances, it was shown as erotic. Even in the country of Cuba itself, it was portrayed as the “other” as compared to the white American characters. This difference was especially seen when classical ballroom dancing was shown alongside Cuban salsa. I thought that was interesting because it seems that comparing two different styles of dance will always attract viewers to the differences in the styles. This movie however seemed to draw on the fact that the cuban style salsa had more hip movement and other differences that make it a more sensual dance. Even at the scene in the club, the camera angles that the director chose highlighted the hips and upper chest areas, further provoking a sensual feel and response. 
	Another thing I found interesting about the movie was how it incorporated the love story line into the dancing. From the way the movie made it appear, it seemed that the couple was struggling with making their dancing “great” until they had a romantic connection. What it seems to me from the class though is that it is totally possible for two salsa dancers to be great dancers, as long as they have chemistry (even if it is not romantic chemistry - it could just be a good amount of tension and just getting along well as leads and follows). As a whole, though, I thought the movie was a fun watch, and it was nice to be able to see the characters do the basic footwork because I was able to count along in my head and follow the steps.

The movie Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is an audible and visually pleasing film that not only captures an interesting historical time period in Cuba, but highlights the beauty of dancing salsa (cuban salsa) through its beautiful cinematic effects. Throughout the whole movie I was entranced by the culturally rich scenes, the fascinating landscape, and captivating dance routines. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because of the music, the dancing, and the insight on cuban culture. The fact that one of my favorite Mexican actors starred in it - Diego Luna - made it all the more enjoyable. Nevertheless, a specific scene that stood out to me was when Javier and Katey were watching her parents dance together on tape and Javier commented something along the lines of “do you see how they dance… like they want to be in each others arms”. This scene was one of my favorites because it made me realize how much connection is formed when dancing. Dancing is more than technical footwork and body movement, it’s a feeling, a live fluid art, and it takes communal effort. It made me see dancing in a new perspective; it made me realize that when you are dancing with someone, you are sharing a part of yourself and letting yourself be guided as well as be the guide to your partner. The dancing in this movie helped me understand that the physical and intangible connection you have with someone while dancing is what ultimately allows for dancing to become a visual art. Without these intangible connections, to the music, to your partner, the passion and fun behind dancing diminishes; because dancing is much more than just rhythmic movement, it’s a form of self expression.  Through this performance lens, one can see that dancing involves much more than the memorization of a routine, and when it comes to dancing cuban salsa you need to be ready to get down and let loose.  This film made me want to travel to Cuba and to start dancing cuban style salsa!

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights is a movie that provides an interesting perspective towards salsa dancing both as a culture and as an art form that relates to other dance forms. The movie portrays salsa dancing as a way for the protagonists to escape the problems they face in their normal lives. for Javier, it allows him to experience happiness during the bloody Cuban revolution, and for Katey, she is able to experience access to the real world from which her parents tried to keep her hidden. It was interesting to watch both characters grow and develop through their journey training for the salsa competition; both Javier and Katey had matured immensely through the duration of their journey, and salsa made this transition smooth and enjoyable. Symbolically, the movie’s conclusion represented the characters’ loss of innocence through their maturity, as presented by their leading the salsa club through their dancing. This was paralleled through the characters’ loss of virginity, a more depiction of losing innocence. Tied into this loss of innocence was salsa dancing, which provided the protagonists with a sense of safety and understanding through their transition into maturity.
A particularly interesting artistic direction employed by the movie was the combination of ballroom dancing with salsa. Combining the moves and styles of these dance forms created an elegant choreographic style that brought out the best in both dances. Certain aspects of dancing seemed exaggerated at certain points, as exemplified by Javier’s teaching Katey to dance salsa using ocean waves as a guide. Exaggerations notwithstanding, the combination of salsa with ballroom dancing provided an interesting and unique platform through which the characters could apply their passions.

I really liked the Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights movie, I thought it was very entertaining and it was very cool to see different styles of salsa and Latin ballroom. I enjoyed seeing Katey and Javier get better as dance partners because by the end of the movie it was obvious that she was more comfortable with Javier as a partner, and they finally had good tension and connection to be dance partners. I had never seen a style of dance like the Cuban style that Javier introduces Katey to, and I was actually kind of surprised by how much she seemed to enjoy watching it in La Rosa Negra. That seemed a little out of character because Katey usually is prim and proper, but that Cuban dancing really brought out her wild side. I don’t think I would have been able to do those dance moves with someone, unless it was someone I knew really well because I am pretty shy, and that dance style had some very intimate moves. Watching them practice, and dance at the competition was also very fun. I hope that I can learn some of those dance moves because I think they did a really good choreography, I really enjoyed all of the dips. I definitely saw some of the moves we have learned in class, like the cross-body lead, in their routine. Katey and Javier seemed to be the only people on the dance floor that moved across the space given, which I think made their routine better than other couples. They also mixed the Cuban dance style with the Ballroom style and I think that this made their routine even better, because it gave them more of a connection, made them seem to have more chemistry, and just made it look like they were having more fun. I think the movie taught me how fluid salsa can be, they have so many different positions to hold each other, and then there are some moves where they are not connected at all, but both are side by side and in sync. I liked the variety in their dancing, though I would probably not do all of those moves in front of my parents—so I think Katey is very brave. Ultimately, the salsa dance that is highlighted in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights represents the power of salsa as a gateway to self-expression, exploration, and freedom through movement and bravery, as displayed by the characters in the movie. I hope to find this bravery by exploring Salsa as well.

	In Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Katey Miller must completely immerse herself into Cuban culture to learn how to dance salsa. Arriving in Cuba, she is sheltered by her parents, the American elite from everything unknown to them, even though they are foreigner’s occupying Cuba’s land. However, Katey cannot seem to separate herself from Cuba like her rich counterparts easily seem to do as they dehumanize the Cuban people. She may not know anything about Cuba, but what she can grasp is dancing. Through salsa, she is able to recognize and let go of the fear preventing her from letting the unknown, Cuba, a boy into her heart. 
	Dancing is a cross-cultural sport that makes room for communication, understanding and ultimately leads to the formation of relationships. To demonstrate this, the movie has a rich, privileged American fall in love with a poor Cuban boy whose job is to serve her. The plot of an unlikely, forbidden romance is an overdone theme in Hollywood movies. In this genre of romance movies, the only aspect that ever changes is the vehicle for the romance, which in this movie is salsa. Hollywood is able use salsa to physically show the growth of the relationship between Katey and Javier. To improve their fluidity between moves, their dancing, their relationship, cannot solely rely on technique and practice. They must instead inspect the intersectionality of dance, of Javier. Katey must learn how to move with the waves of the Cuban ocean and  understand the revolution that has shaped Javier’s entire life. As an American, her relationship with Cuba is dynamic, so her dancing must reflect that. 
	In the end, Katey and Javier learn how dance, and trust in each other but Katey is still an American and Javier is still Cuban. Katey must go to college in the United States while Javier must witness the results of the Cuban revolution.

	Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was an incredibly fun movie to watch.  First of all, I’d never heard of it beforehand, and seeing Diego Luna so young was really entertaining.  Also, I do find myself listening to salsa or other Latin music quite regularly, but I rarely get to hear and see it on screen.  This piqued my interest and has made me want to watch more movies like Havana Nights in the future.
The movie also felt relatable in some ways.  As I’m not super informed on the history and politics of Cuba, I can’t speak to the accuracy of the film in that regard.  However, I found many of Katey’s experiences relatable and accurate in comparison to things that I’ve felt.  For example, I’ve definitely stood in front of a mirror trying to figure out body isolations and just been moving around so awkwardly I’d have been mortified had anyone walked in.  Also, in the year since I started going to Open Práctica, I’ve barely begun getting comfortable with dancing intimately with someone in such close proximity.  The montage where Javier and Katey were rehearsing and she’d slap him or back away when he touched her chest really reminded me of myself when leads signal to body roll or dip me.  I’m still working on going with it instead of stiffening up.
It’s hard to explain, but I also related to Katey’s experience in that salsa for me is unlike any type of dance or activity I’ve ever been involved in, so it brings me not just out of my comfort zone, but almost immerses me in a different world, and a whole new culture.
Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie.  Though so many of the scenes were cringe-worthy or generally cheesy, the music cinematography were great and it was fun to be watching it surrounded by salsa dancers of many levels, and I could tell that my classmates found aspects of it relatable as well.

To be completely honest, I’m an original Dirty Dancing fan, and typically am not in favor of movie remakes. That said, the type of dancing in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was way more interesting to watch, especially considering we’ve been practicing salsa for a few weeks now. Despite there being complex moves I haven’t learned how to do in every dance, I could still watch their feet always using the basic step, which seems to be all you really need at the end of the day! 
I also appreciated Patrick Swayze having a part in the movie to rep the original, and while I may be a remake snob, I can definitely still enjoy a cheesy dance movie. The script may have been really superficial at times but I enjoyed the scenes at night clubs where everyone was just feeling the music and dancing with one another. In addition, I liked that, in the end, the main characters decided to stay with their families; it was good Katey wasn’t giving up a college education and that Javier was staying to finish the revolution his father had been working towards – and left it open ended for a possible spicy reunion. ;)
I think both lifestyles in the movie were exaggerated; Katey’s rich, country club family wasn’t representative of all affluent families, and Javier’s culture as a local Cuban was exaggerated as well. At the same time, the exaggerations were based on some true cultural differences, which I thought were brought together in an interesting way. They brought up some questions involving class, race, and gender which are still present today. 
Last but not least, the scene where Javier taught Katey to dance with the flow of the waves was by far the most cheesy part of the entire movie, but hey, maybe the DeCal should take a field trip. You never know if we may find ourselves amongst the flow of the waves. (lol)

Juan Alba
Racial Division in Salsa
	In director Guy Ferland’s film, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, a young American girl named Katey moves with her family to Havana, Cuba, for her father’s work. During a date with another American boy at a nearby Cuban club, she meets Javier, a local hotel worker, who dances Salsa with her for the rest of the night. When Katey dances with Javier, she becomes inspired by how other Cuban women feel and dance to the music. Katey’s admiration for Cuban Salsa is buffered by a random man who dances Salsa in the resort she lives in, who proposes her to sign up for a Salsa competition. Despite having trouble getting Javier to jump on board to be her partner for the competition, Katey ultimately convinces him to start training. 
	During her training, Katey learns about her true identity through Salsa dancing. Due to the great racial and cultural differences between Javier and her, Katey often feels afraid to be seen with him. However, when they both merge to dance, they forget about these cultural differences and become one with the music. Ferland’s depiction of Katey’s fears reveals the racial division in Havana during this time. In one side, the wealthy Americans who live in the resorts are more drawn to ballroom dancing. In the other side, the humble Cubans dance the night away hot and crowded Salsa clubs. Despite coming from different socio-economic backgrounds, Katey and Javier both learn from each other’s dances to improve their performance. The way the film associates rich white people to ballroom dancing and poor cubans to Salsa dancing reveals the importance of these styles of dance in the cultural identity of these people. Though Katey is forced to leave Javier at the end of the movie, they both learn that in order to improve a dance, they must be open-minded to change.

Like any dancing movie, really, this movie was very cheesy, but I did love the displays of dancing throughout! I wish there were more dancing scenes outside of the main characters’ own experiences. The salsa dancing in this movie was different than types I had seen before, more intimate and sensual than I have been exposed to. I think I have seen more professional forms of Salsa, like in the competition, than club salsa dancing. Seeing how the people who danced moved so freely made me realize that I need more movement and I need to release my own tension. Being rigid or stiff may help in other forms of dance, but if you want to flow and move in order to “feel the music”, you have to let loose and relax. I also wish that they had used more well-known salsa music or used more Latinx music instead of the Black Eyed Peas and Christina Aguilera. I believe there would have been more cultural appreciation if the movie used more culturally relevant music. Also, it seems as if there was an attempt to shed light on the Cuban Revolution, but it did so in ways that were irrelevant to the plot, and that were oddly placed, making very loosely based connections. If they really wanted to have some sort of plot connection, I think there should have been more attention paid to what was going on around them and how music and dancing played a part in the revolution or the resistance. Overall, I believe that this movie was pretty bad, but the dancing is what saved it. It was beautiful to see that they mixed different types of dancing into this movie; the more formal kind that the main character’s parents danced, the casual dancing on the street, competition dancing, and club dancing. It represents different faces and facets of dance, not reducing it to just one “correct” or “main” type. Dancing comes in all forms, and can be translated into others as well.

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights Write-Up
I found “Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” to be a classic example of a member movie gone wrong, in that the story and acting came across as boring and uninteresting. The characters, aside from Diego Luna, played uninspiring figures in progressing the story and were not helped by their cliché dialogue. I also was lost on the entire purpose of the movie when by the end Luna decided to forget about the cash prize at the competition and instead place full confidence in the revolution. This plot point seemed to trivialize the entire point of the film and left a sense of distaste in my mouth. I also didn’t like the revolutions role in the film and the two romances the main actress gets involved in, it only seemed out of place and a desperate attempt at creating an emotional connection with the audience when there was none to be had.  The cash grab that this movie represented was also fully aware in its purpose when Patrick Swayze makes a cameo appearance that feels extremely out of place, especially considering the previous film. The dancing however was fun to watch and made me want to improve my own dancing style. So overall, I can say that the film accomplished the reason it was shown: to inspire us to become better dancers. If a white book smart girl from the United States could literally beat out professional dancers, who’s to say I can’t aspire to such heights? 
	Would I watch this film again? Probably not. It represents a highly fictionalized and Hollywood-esque take on the Cuban revolution and salsa in general. For this reason, I could only ever see this film as a made for tv flick, wherein you have the talents of a fantastic actor – Diego Luna – go to waste after his amazing role in Y Tu Mama Tambien. I would go so far as to ask whether Patrick Swayze has ever seen the film.

	I enjoyed watching Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights very much over the past two weeks in our DeCal class. It was very interesting to get to know a different Salsa culture, that is, the dirty dancing in Cuba. The way the plot was devised was helpful for viewers like us, because most of us were as new to the Cuban culture as the Americans in the film were, from the language barrier, to the cultural ignorance, and especially the dancing. I can imagine having the same reaction as Katey when she had just arrived at the - being totally put off by the openness of the dancing in La Rosa Negra. 
	The plot development was exaggerated in my opinion. In real life, it is unfortunately rarely the case that people of such distant social classes, that of Katey and Javier, have so much opportunity to interact, and have enough in common to fall in love with each other. Nonetheless, I do think the development of their romantic interactions is magnified and expedited for good reasons. It is a movie after all, so I do not expect them to put in an everyday-life type of storyline. 
	My favorite part would definitely be the first round of the Latin ballroom contest, where Javier and Katey danced beautifully, and fearlessly in front of all the more professional dancers, and most importantly, Katey’s parents’ disapproval. It was absolutely great to see her parents understand, or rather, give in, to allowing Katey pursue her love, though that is also a less realistic aspect since most parents would probably do everything to stop this from happening. 
	Another aspect I enjoyed was Javier’s character. He is not the average Cuban boy with great dancing skills. His patience and guidance for Katey was so valuable in the relationship, and really made the romance between the two possible.

Dirty Dancing Havana Nights 
Paper# 1
Reflection on Dirty Dancing Havana Nights
	The ability to defy expectations and barriers is a quality that the two protagonists embodied in the move Dirty Dancing Havana Nights. Their mutual love for music and for one another manifested in powerful statements against the divisions that ruled their lives. It was interesting to watch how Katey and Javier were able to bring both of their cultural backgrounds and create something new and unique. I related to Katey and her desire to interact with people from different backgrounds and break free of the constraints placed on her by family. I enjoyed watching her strength in standing up to those that got in her way. It was inspiring to see that those around Katey and Javier who initially opposed their relationship, in the end supported their dedication to dance and their love for one another. Their bond through music was moving and moved those around them in unexpected ways. I enjoyed watching the transformation of Katey’s sister, who was initially opposed, but then after understanding Katey’s love for Javier was truly invested in their flourishing. Specifically, with regard to the dancing, their footwork was impressive. Their mix of the two dances was unique. I hope to be able to dance like Katey after taking the intermediate DeCal. The dresses that Katey wore were vibrant and really accentuated the dances. Overall, the entire incorporation of the differences in music, politics, backgrounds, love, and dancing lead to perfect barrier defying dances between Javier and Katey. While I assume the ending was more realistic this way, I was pleased that that the two didn’t end up being together.

	“Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights” was quite entertaining, although it was exceedingly cheesy at times. But I don’t think it being cheesy detracts from the positive aspects of the movie. The positive aspects being that it is a fun, upbeat movie that shows off some pretty sweet dancing. That being said, I don’t really think the plot of the movie, in regards to dancing, runs much deeper than this.
	The movie did not portray dancing as a significant part of the revolution going on simultaneously with the timeline of the events in the movie. It showed certainly that dancing is an integral part of the culture, but the movie did not seem to expand on that idea much and, instead, focused on the drama between the two main characters and the their relationship leading up to the competition. In this way, it was difficult to much relate to either of the main characters in particular, because the movie does not really draw the viewer in to any internal conflict within either of the characters. The most I could relate to either of them is that I really love dancing, which is also what made the movie enjoyable, despite its cheesiness. But since the main connection the movie invoked was one relatively straight forward as enjoying dancing, and enjoying that dancing was the medium that the story progressed through, it did not impart any real significant or deep meaning as I watched it. But again, a movie does not necessarily need to do this in order to be enjoyable.
	As a final comment, I think most of the drama within the movie was exaggerated, but I could believe the rest of the movie was relatively accurate. I have not had any experience in Cuban nightclubs, but I imagine that there are nightclubs that resemble the one in the movie quite closely. And I could also believe that the gap between the types of people living there, wealthy Americans and less wealthy locals, is also relatively accurate.

	This semester I've only been able to attend one of the Gio’s events in addition to Open Practica and a workshop. The Gio’s event in September was my first experience dancing socially outside of Thursday OP. I’m glad I had the opportunity to experience one of the Salsa at Cal events, it was amazingly packed and there was a great variety of dancers as well as many familiar faces. Clearly, social dancing this way is one of the fastest ways to see quick dance skill improvement - I felt improved after just the one event, because I was pushed to dance with people of higher skill levels so I learned some new patterns!
	The workshop was a bachata intensive workshop with Kathy Reyes. This has to be one of my favorite experiences in dance so far! Kathy was full of passion and energy to teach us, which made it so fun and a great experience overall. The most difficult part of this workshop was the footwork segment. Besides being hard to see her footsteps with so many other people in the room, the song we did the steps to was pretty quick. I don't remember too much from this part because choreography is difficult for me to learn in such a short amount of time, but it was still memorable. My favorite thing we learned was musicality. We learned through a specific song how during an intro we can stylistically move through the music. This was so helpful to learn a new repertoire of simple moves that look cool and keep the beginning interesting. I hope to continue working on musicality skills and improve them. 
	Another great part to the workshop was partnering. This gave both leads and follows to switch roles and try both parts in the interest of learning what it is like to both lead and be led into a turn and the proper tension and grip to have. Traditional leads got to feel what it’s like to be turned forcefully, and how nice it is to be turned gently. This reminded me of how I want to learn to lead salsa and bachata.

	It was my first time attending a latin social dance event, the event was not as exciting as I thought it would be because my friend and I were both beginners. Nevertheless, With more practice, we will be able to enjoy dancing at a social dance event much more in future events.  On the bright side, I had a pretty good time with my friend, we pregamed at my place and then walked together to Gio’s together. Furthermore, I was able to see my other friends from Salsa outside of class and that was pretty fun since I enjoy socializing with other people as much as I enjoy dancing.. A few of my friends is taking this class because they want to connect better with their culture, my other friends are taking this class because they just want to meet new people and destress from their hectic life at Berkeley, and then there is me, I am taking this class for many reasons. Most of my friend are Hispanic so I thought it would be nice for me to connect with their culture and at the same having to opportunity to destress and meet new people.

My friend and I were dancing to a song and she told me this song is very popular from where she is from. I suddenly started thinking about my homeland and how when I listen to the songs from there, it generates a certain feeling of sadness that is really hard to describe and it is definitely not nostalgia. Suddenly, I feel disconnected from her culture as much as I am connected to mine. I think I might have to learn Spanish if I want to connect with the Hispanic culture  on a more profound level.

I went to the first Gio’s Pizza and Bocce Salsa Event and I found it nervewracking! I found it nervewracking because the social dancing norms differed with the DeCal’s in-class norms and I was nervous about how well I would be able to follow outside of the classroom setting.
	During the DeCal, we rotate partners every few minutes and generally follow the choreography of our instructors. I was nervous when I went social dancing because I realized finding a dance party was not as seamless and easy in social settings as it is in the classroom. In social settings, I or a lead must build the courage to ask for a dance partner. I found myself looking around for familiar faces, so I would not feel too out of my comfort zone, have a higher likelihood of someone saying yes, and reduce my chances of embarrassment or rejection. I asked a few people to dance and a few people asked me to dance. I don’t know if this comes down to my personality or the interactive dynamic between dance partners, but the idea of being asked or asking someone else to dance made me feel a larger need to be the perfect dancer so they would not be disappointed by my dancing skills, regret asking me or accepting my proposal, and embarrassed for me.
	Since I attended a social dancing event at the beginning of the semester, I did not know many moves, and I was very aware of that. I tried to keep up with partners who knew more moves than me, but felt embarrassed whenever I messed up on my attempts of new moves and even on the simple moves! However, I found that it was important to find a partner I felt comfortable with. I danced later with a friend who knew I was still learning. He encouraged me while dancing, saying I did specific moves nicely, which made me feel more confident and have a more pleasant dancing experience.

	Dirty Dancing : Havana Nights was a film that attempted to demonstrate differences in cultures through dance and it chose to do so by setting the film in a n interesting point in time during Cuban history. I think this film had good intentions and it was a little admirable to see them not ignore the hard times that the citizens of Cuba went through during their revolution. However, admirable I thought it was I think they did a huge disservice to the hardships that many of the in the Cuban civilian population went through during the authoritarian dictatorship largely backed and facilitated by the Unites States government. I think that the directors wish of having an extra layer of complexity to the movie ruined its artistic value. 
	I think what this film did do well is highlight the passion behind that Cubans and a lot of Latino/Hispanics put into music and dancing. It’s a way to express themselves and infuse a beautiful and specific flare from respective cultures infuse into their dance movements. I liked the visible connection the two main protagonists had in the film. Their clothing during dancing scenes was an interesting to observe throughout the film.  It seemed to accentuate their dance moves well and another dimension to their dancing.  I think I was able to appreciate the dancing scenes more after taking this dancing class. I tried to focus on their transitions, foot movements, body posture and overall technique with a much more critical eye. I was able to be more cognoscente about how difficult it is to make all the dance sequences look so effortless. 
I think one of the biggest things I tool from the dancing aspect was the trust the protagonists had to have in each other. Once they developed that trust with each other they were able to showcase their individual skills and their passion was almost tangible on screen and we see how they both learned from each other and grew as dancers. Over all the film was decent and their cheesy lines were hilarious and kept me entertained throughout.

I loved the movie Dirty Dancing – Havana Nights. Coming from Peru, music makes me feel more connected to my Latin culture. There were some aspects of the movie that I really liked.

First, we could see how salsa music is so engrained in Latin American culture. The scene when Katey finds Javier dancing in the park reminded me of the parks of Lima, where you find people all the weekends dancing salsa, merengue, etc. People get together and practice dancing and teach others who want to join. 

Other aspect that I liked was to see some Cubans singing when they dance. This is something that is a lot more common and was not completely reflected in the movie. Most of Latin Americans sing all the songs, as they are part of their culture. In my opinion, it is difficult to be really passionate about salsa or bachata and not to know the lyrics of some songs.
Another funny part was to see how the relationship between Katey and Javier evolves as both have a common passion for dancing. This happens in reality and partners sometimes become a couple.

On the other hand, I think the movie exaggerated how people touch their partners when they dance, especially in the first scene at La Rosa Negra. I have been in many salsa clubs in Latin America, and it is true that Latin rhythms are very corporal and partners have high level of contact. However, the movie emphasized that too much to a level that does not reflect reality.

Overall, it was a funny experience and I could say the movie reminded me some reasons of why I love dancing salsa.
