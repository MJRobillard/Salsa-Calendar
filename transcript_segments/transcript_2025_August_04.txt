In September I attended a club event at Gio’s Pizza that a latinx org was having. It was a really fun experience and it was not like dancing at the DeCal. At the event there was a lot of different type of music such as hip hop, reggaeton, cumbia, banda, salsa, and bachata. I had gone to club events before but for the salsa and bachata songs I had danced with friends and not with a partner. When a bachata song came on someone asked me to dance and I had a chance to apply some of the things I had learned during class and office hours. Although I did not know many moves I was able to last the whole song and it did not feel too repetitive, I even learned some new moves. It felt nice dancing in a social setting outside of the class because I did not know what to expect. The people that I danced with had different levels of experience, most were more experienced than me so I was a bit nervous about dancing with them because I only knew a few steps and turns but it was really fun.
One thing that I learned during social dancing is the importance of tension. During class I know what to expect because we follow a routine but when I was dancing outside of class I did not know the next step the lead was going to do. I had to pay attention to the tension in my arms to know what the next move was going to be. This is something I want to continue improving on because sometimes when the lead makes a cue I do not read it correctly and end up doing a turn instead of a hair comb. 
Social dancing has made me more excited to learn salsa and bachata, even though I still have a lot more to learn I’m so ready to continue improving. I need to continue to go to  more social dancing events and not just rely on open practica and office hours, although those are very helpful.

Salsa Essay 2: Sanya Sehgal
	I attended a Salsa event at Gio’s that the salsa club held back in September. It was very interesting to go social dancing, I had never been social dancing before. I thought it was pretty cool to be able to use the skills I had learned in class. I was pretty nervous that I was going to have a hard time following with people I had never danced with before, but it was more or less fine for the most part. I danced with about four people, and I think I was able to follow pretty well. Most of the people I danced with were also somewhat beginners, so it wasn’t too difficult, because I was somewhat familiar with all of the moves they tried. I did dance with one person who was at a higher level, and that was pretty cool because I learned some new things and got to see how well I could follow when I don’t know the moves as well. 
I brought a friend along as well and the two of us came for the lesson beforehand, which was also really nice because we both got to get into dancing salsa with new partners, before the social dancing began. My dance partner for the lesson was also a beginner so we learned together, and then when the social dancing began, we danced together as well. I think it went pretty well, but I would like to dance with more experienced dancers as well in the future because that seems like it would be a fun experience.   I am excited to learn more salsa and, in the future, go to more salsa social events because I had fun for a while. I was even able to work up the courage to ask a few people to dance. 
I learned a lot from that social dancing experience and I think it was good because now I understand the dancing more intuitively, as opposed to knowing what each move is going to be, I am able to feel the tension and pay attention to body language and predict and follow what the lead is about to do.

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was a movie I could see myself watching at a middle school sleepover. When Patrick Swayze was plopped into the plot, I couldn’t help but gush as I had as a teen with my pre-teen friend group years ago. And Javier? God, he was on par with Chad Michael Murray. A-dork-able. And what teenage girl doesn’t love a good love story? And subsequently, a little hope for her own future…
I saw a lot of myself in Katey at the beginning of the movie: well-meaning, shy, and overly academic. That scene where she almost turned down the party because of homework was super relatable. This part of her character was super developed in the beginning of the movie, but she kinda lost it toward the end. The movie didn’t portray any sort of tension as she transitioned away from her nerdy-self to her new form as a  young-and-sweet-only-17 dancing queen. I just don’t think that transition would have been so easy in practice, or so fast.
I was also surprised with how quickly Katey’s parents came to terms with her relationship with Javier. I see this sort of forgiveness/ reconciliation all the time in movies, and it’s super hopeful but… exaggerated and unrealistic I think. I mean, good for her? I just cannot see this happening so quickly (or for that matter at all) in my own family. 
I really like how Javier’s dancing was less structured and more about “feeling” it – or at least this is what he expressed about his own dancing. Of course a proper framework is great for dancing, but I feel like I’ve been super caught up in the framework so far in the class. I’m hoping to loosen up a little and find my own groove in the coming weeks. I got a good start on that goal at office hours after we watched the movie, and am getting excited about putting in time in the future to “feel” and to develop my own distinct style.

	“Dancing is about being exactly who you want to be in that moment” – Katey Miller. I’m not sure if I have a favorite part in the movie since I was fully entertain from beginning to end but I definitely have a favorite quote. When Katey mentioned how little by little she was becoming exactly who she wanted to be I started to identify with the message the movie was trying to get across. It’s not just about dancing, or winning a contest, the message I got out of this whole story was about the process of becoming the person you truly are rather than the person everyone wants you to be. It’s corny I know but it’s relatable. The way Katey felt when she moved to Cuba was the same way I felt when I came to UC Berkeley. She minded her own business, alone and always working in order to make her parents and teachers proud. Now there’s nothing wrong with any of that but in the process it seemed that Katie forgot to consider what she really wanted for herself and what made her happy in the end. From freshman year till junior year every decision I made had to pass one simple question, “Is what I’m about to do getting me closer to my career goal?” Unfortunately most fun things that involve socializing and spending quality time with the people I cared about would not pass that question. Although it wasn’t part of the movie I feel like the character of Katey would have a similar mentality with regards as to how she went about her day. However, as she started dancing and started living more in the moment than in her own head she started to become more in tune with the person she wanted to become. Being the worst dancer everywhere you go was another thing I immediately related to but I’m glad Katie push through that discomfort in the movie and I hope I can do the same thing in order to learn not just how to dance but how to be present and live in the moment.

	The film Dirty Dancing Havana Nights was fun to watch especially when there were dance scenes. The energy and choreography put into the dance sequences was motivational to watch and full of impressive moves, some that I’m familiar with and many I’ve never seen before. I enjoy watching more advanced dancers as it helps me begin to understand where the beats are in a song and see different ways to move along with the music. The transition of Katey’s dancing as she goes from her more controlled ballroom style training to learning to embrace her body’s movements and dancing with Javier as she loosens up and finds passion in her dancing. The music in the film was also great to listen to while watching the dancers. Watching them move to the rhythm of a song was great. I payed special attention tot he costumes worn when competing and what was worn for just going out to the club. The gowns worn for competition were especially beautiful and flow with the moves so they look cool while moving about. I’m always looking at the different types of dancing shoes people dance in to get a feel of what heels and shoes are appropriate for dancing out.
Overall as a film, the storyline seemed a bit cheesy and predictable but also very funny and cute. I liked the film even better now watching it for a second time and I got to watch the whole story this time rating than just skipping through to the dace scenes which allowed me to better
understand the circumstance there in Cuba the the characters were facing. I haven’t watched the original fully and the important dance scenes we watched in class were very good and make me want to learn more and keep practicing even though learning to dance is awkward at times, but it’s so much fun and I hope to gain and improve my dancing skills a lot!

	What I liked about the movie accurately portrayed the racism era it was set in. When Javier and Katey take the dance for at the Christmas Ball, the look of disgust on all the old white people’s faces seemed to reflect the sentiment of the time. I was pretty funny to see the looks on their faces as that is something we really don’t think about now a days. Several times throughout the movie, the line “He’s not one of us,” was used  to try to dissuade Katey from continuing her relationship. I like that at the end of the movie, the mother who got to the point of slapping  Katey for her actions was eventually supportive of what she was doing and even suggested a move to make their final dance more impressive. I really didn’t like James as a character as he was a douche. I don’t like how nothing ever really happened to him after he assaulted Katey because she was too afraid to speak up about it to her mom, and instead the person walking her home and keeping her safe after the event go screwed over by the event. I think my favorite part of the movie was Javier’s transition from being just a street/club dancer to a more formal dancer that still largely kept his style. What I really did not like about the movie was the fact that they do the same dance for both parties. Nothing really changes in their choreography from the 1st dance to the 2nd except for adding in the turn her mother suggests. That just seems lazy and uncreative. They could have at least changed up more for their routine, but nothing was really done or shown in the movie in the week between the dances. I liked the street dancing that they showed when Katey is walking home. It seems like a lot of fun to be in public and dancing with people of all ages and just generally having a great time with the people of your community. My favorite part of the movie was that they kept Patrick Swayze as the random dance instructor that is hired for the country club. Even though he isn’t a big character in the movie, his character has continuity between the 2 Dirty Dancing movies.

	The last time I went out dancing was this Saturday at Pura Nightclub in San Francisco. It was my first time going and it was amazing to see the four different dance floors all blasting different genres of latin music. If my friends and I were in the mood for reggaeton we would go to the main room or if we wanted to dance bachata we would just switch over to a different room. What was different was definitely the culture, which of course is to be expected because it’s a club. In the decal or open práctica the objective is to learn how to dance and everyone is really focused on learning the moves and collaborating with their partner. In the club setting it was interesting because on the night I was there it seemed the vast majority of people were not partner dancing (it might have been just because it was extremely crowded). It mostly consisted of groups of friends all getting down in dance circles, which was fun too. However, I was really looking forward to practice partner dancing salsa and bachata, it was still a really good time dancing with friends though. We practiced the liquid lead technique and would switch off leading. I did dance with a person that was not in my friend group who did not know how to dance salsa or bachata so it was a really good learning experience trying to be the lead and guide him through some dance moves. I think through that experience I’ve developed more of an understanding for the lead’s role and in turn how I can improve as a follow in really keeping engaged with my lead to not stumble by missing a signal. Overall, it was a great experience and I look forward to going back and putting to use the moves I’ve learned in class.

	I went to one of the Gio’s salsa nights and it was a lot of fun! I didn’t have many expectations going into the event. My main experience with social dancing comes from going to swing dance events. There, it’s all about dancing and the music. There’s a huge dance floor, and that’s it. Gio’s was a mix of a social dance scene and a bar, which I found...interesting. I think I would have preferred if it had been focused only on dancing. The “main” area was rather crowded with people that were standing and talking with their friends. I thought this was fine, but just not what I was looking for.
	One thing that struck me was how much bachata was played! I thought it would be at least half salsa and half bachata, but it felt like 4 out of 5 songs were salsa. At first I was a bit disappointed, but seeing great bachata dancers inspired me to learn more bachata. By the end of the night, I found that I was having quite a bit of fun dancing both. It also motivated me to attend Kathy Reyes’ bachata workshop, which I found very useful!
	Compared to the DeCal, it was a rather different experience. In the DeCal, I feel much more comfortable messing up, pausing, counting out loud, and doing other beginner-level moves. I felt much more pressure to “be a good lead.” Overall, the followers at the social event were also very good. I noticed that because they followers do not know what the next move will be, there is no way for them to back-lead of anticipate what you will do. I think this practice was good for me as a lead. For example, I realized that there were a few moves like the running man that I just would not do a good job of leading. I hadn’t noticed this before since the followers in the DeCal would usually correct for any bad leading. I also realized that there are some salsa song where I definitely struggle to find the “one” (and not confusing it with the “five”).
	Another interesting difference that I noticed was the floor. I always thought only advanced dancers would appreciate the difference between different floors, but I noticed that the floor was a bit more sticky than the dance floors in the DeCal. This wasn’t a big issue, but it made some turns a bit more difficult.

	I have been going to Ashkenaz every month since I moved to Berkeley. So far, Ashkenaz has been my favorite monthly dance event. I really enjoy the crowd there and meeting new people. I like that it is mostly bachata dancing, my favorite dance style, and I also like that they play some  salsa songs, which helps me improve my salsa dancing skills. I did my first birthday dance in September at Ashkenaz, which was super fun. I loved dancing with different people during one song and quickly switching between the leads. At first, it was a little bit overwhelming to quickly switch dancing with partners, especially because each dancer had a different dancing style which I had to match, but I enjoyed it a lot after getting a minute to adjust. 
What I like the most about social dancing is that I get to dance with individuals that have different dancing skills. I enjoy dancing with my classmates at the DeCal, where we get to practice together; However, social dancing allows me to learn faster as I dance with people with different dancing experiences and at different levels. Although dance classes are critical, I realized over time that I learn much faster while social dancing as I solidify the steps I learned in class and expand on the moves and the styling. Even when I get busy and I do not have the time to go social dancing, I force myself to go every other week  in order to improve my dancing skills and keep remembering the steps I learned in class. 
While I was at Ashkenaz, I noticed a lot of people using the dance moves that we learned in class. A few leaders that I have danced with have also used some of the moves that we learned at the DeCal and I was able to follow them; it was good to practice those moves outside of class. Things that were taught in lecture applied as well. The dance etiquette lecture was important in my opinion, as well as the lecture when we learned about the instruments used in Latin music.

Aside from the open practica’s held on Thursdays I was able to attend “Salsa on Sproul” on October 12th.  I enjoyed this event very much and just like past social dances such as Gio’s my experience was great!  I always enjoy going to these events because it gives me a chance to practice my salsa/bachata skills, meet new people and learn fun combos. With that being said, my favorite part about these social dances is when I get to dance with random people; I know that for some this may be very intimidating but I enjoy it since it gives me an opportunity to learn different dancing techniques and styles. As a person who loves to dance, I never go to events having any expectations except to have fun and dance the night away with my friends. Ever since I was little I loved to dance to anything from bachata to corridos to merengue or cumbia, but now being away from home and attending a predominantly caucasian institution I have not gotten many opportunities to dance to my latin music I grew up listening to. Which is why Salsa at Cal caught my attention ever since my first semester here at Cal, I loved how there were so many other people who shared a passion for latin music like me. The events Salsa at Cal puts on such as the ones I have attended on sproul, at Gio’s and others remind me a little of home. At these events I have danced with international exchange students from latin america, with friends, with older men and women who have all been super friendly. As someone who always follows there have instances where I dance with someone who knows way more moves than me and after a few missed turns and late cues I finally learn a new spin I can add to my repertoire. Because of open practica’s, the salsa decal and these social events I have noticed that my dancing has gotten a lot better and my confidence has grown, and as a result I have become more comfortable dancing in front of people and with strangers.

	I’ve been to a couple events outside of the decal but my favorite so far has been Salsa on Sproul. It was so much fun to connect and dance with people I knew from the decal as well as people I met at the event. Some of the people I met on Sproul I see every now and then at other events like Gio’s and Ashkenaz. 
	Honestly, dancing outside of class is incredibly freeing because there is less pressure to do the move correctly and more emphasis on just dancing and feeling the music. Regardless of whether you are dancing with an experienced partner or someone who just learned, your goal is not to perform a complex sequence of steps but just to enjoy yourself. Mistakes are expected and passed over when they happen. It’s also interesting to dance with different people who all have slightly varied styles and techniques. I think that adapting to a new way of dancing with every partner did a lot to improve my responsiveness. 
	At the same time, I really appreciate the drilling that we did in class because it has made salsa feel much more natural. Now I know (generally) how someone signals a turn and how the right amount of tension can make you more responsive to your partner. 
	I definitely liked dancing in a non class setting far more because it let me really let go and enjoy salsa as social activity and I can’t wait to go to more events.

There’s a lot of differences between class and Ashkenaz. There’s definitely more than listed here, but there’s not a lot I can fit on one page so here are the most relevant points to my experience.
The main difference is that it’s a lot harder to pick out the beat. There are people talking and clamoring and looking for their friends and you’re standing there confused and unable to really hear the beat. Because you’re unable to hear the beat you’re relying on your partner. Sometimes your partner has a hard time hearing over the music too and therefore you’re both struggling. While I was at Ashkenaz, I had no difficulty hearing the music and beat. I could not say the same for my partners. I danced with a lot of people and I realized how difficult it must be for people to pick it up on the fly.
The second, and less important, difference is that your partner often has no idea what to do with you when the only thing you can do reliably is your basic or the only thing they can do is the basic. Anything else is just asking to be stepped on. I would argue that this particular situation is because most of the people I danced with were just learning how to dance bachata which means we were all suffering together as Kathy Reyes tried to form us into decent dancers. This brings us to my last point.
Kathy Reyes is a powerful and terrifying being. She’s an amazing dancer and an amazing instructor, but also completely and utterly terrifying in her perpetual optimism and belief that you too can excel at dancing. I’m not an amazing dancer and being in the same room as her was a difficult experience because I had a hard time keeping up. It was also an amazing experience because I grew a lot very quickly. No losses.

I went to a dance club called 3 Vinos when I went back home to Southern California. It is a restaurant/entertainment bar that has themed events several days a week. I went on, a Saturday, and they had a Cumbia and Salsa event. This was the first time I had gone to a club or dancing event specifically themed for this type of music. It was very different than dancing in the DeCal. This was especially because I felt very intimidated by the amount of people there who seemed very good at dancing, and it all looked so natural. Everyone was well dressed, the music was great, the amount of people there was immense! It definitely exceeded my expectations as to how fancy but ambiently welcoming the event was. I went with family, so I didn’t feel extremely intimidated as most of the time I was just dancing within my own group, but seeing how others randomly came up to ask one of my family members to dance was interesting to see, yet made me a little uncomfortable. It is nice to dance with others outside of your own group because they may have a different style, but at the same time it is intimidating if you are not at the level that they are, and it may be embarrassing! I danced pretty basic moves, did turns, none of the combos we have learned in class so far, I used. I really had to tune into my senses and cues, something we have been talking about, to get a feel to where my lead is trying to take me. I had to really feel that tension and pay attention to what was next, but at the same time, go with the flow which I found to be quite difficult. We have the ability to mess up and try again in the DeCal, but in these clubs, you just go on to the next move and try not to mess up again which is a bit stressful but an experience nonetheless. t was an exhilarating experience, I hope to go to another event like this again, but hopefully with much more practice, confidence, and material that I can showcase!

	In September, I went to a Salsa at Cal event at Gio’s. I went after work and thought I would feel too tired to dance for very long, but I actually had a great time. I met up with some friends I had from beginner salsa which made the night more comfortable because if I wasn’t dancing with anyone, I had other people to hang out with or to dance together in a group. I really liked the music and enjoyed going because I had a basic foundation from the beginner level class last semester. Even though it’s always intimidating to ask someone to dance, it felt more natural to ask partners to dance with me since I felt like I had enough experience to be an acceptable dance partner. I really enjoyed the music because there was a variety, thus allowing us all to practice both bachata and salsa. The DJ even threw in some meringue for fun, which seemed to excite a lot of people. I didn’t know how to do it so I just tried to watch everyone else to see what the moves were supposed to look like. I liked that most of the partners I had were very respectful of space and allowed me to distance myself a bit if I felt the need. All the salseros at the events are so talented, and even though I had the basics down for both bachata and salsa, I felt slightly overwhelmed as I tried to remember the steps and be the best partner I possibly could. I wholeheartedly believe that dancing with people who are better than you are will make you into a much better and more versatile dancer. 
	I have been having a very busy semester, so I haven’t been able to make it out to any other socials, but I remember from last semester that Bachata Nights at Ashkenaz on the first Thursday of every month were by far the most fun and the best socials that Salsa at Cal does. Everyone dances so freely and is so excited to be there for solely bachata. I felt like I learned the most by dancing at those events, so I’m hoping to make it to the December event when the semester ends and dead week starts.

	I attended “Halloween Dance Party with Live Latin Music!” at Gio’s on October 27th with Emmanuel. From 8-11pm we worked the event by setting up, checking people in, etc. Once we were done, we stayed to dance and ran into Alejandro and some of his friends. With Alejandro leading the calls, we danced several rueda songs. It was exciting because Alejandro taught threw some of the more complex moves at us, such as enchufla doble con dile que no and setenta. I thoroughly enjoyed the rueda because we had a small group of only 3-4 couples. However, one of the couples had never danced rueda and did not know what the calls meant, so that messed up our flow a little bit. Salsa rueda is interesting because it relies on everybody understanding what to do and keeping a certain amount of energy. When one lead or follow is off, it affects other couples as well. But that is one of the things that makes salsa rueda so fun- it requires teamwork.
	Besides dancing rueda, we danced salsa and bachata. I decided to attempt leading Emmanuel, since I had recently learned about liquid lead following. I found bachata to be much easier to lead, as it is typically slower. Salsa was harder because I tend to: 1) start by stepping back like a follow instead of stepping forward, 2) forget which way to turn the follow so that they are comfortable, and 3) signal in a very casual manner which my follow often interprets as a different move. Of course, at this event I had not had very much practice as a lead, so it makes sense that I was struggling, but I found that I felt pretty discouraged when my leading was not good. I definitely have more appreciation for people who start off leading. It’s a tough job. Honestly, I prefer following because I love to spin and be sassy, but I want to become good at leading to break gender norms. I just need to keep practicing at events like this one.

I went to the salsa @ cal fall fiesta at gio's Pizza and bocce. It was a fun event, and I'm very happy that I went. I hope salsa @ Cal has more events like this.

The dancing experience was definitely very different from class. For example, there wasn't that much space. I spent the first 30 minutes trying to figure out how to not accidentally step on people. This taught me the usefulness of closed position as a way of stopping your partner from crashing into someone. It was also fun just dancing with lots of people. I also liked how there was a lesson before the social dance, as it was fun to participate in and gave us a quick refresher.

Dancing dances that we don’t do in class was also fun, as I had no idea what to do, and just imitated everyone else. For example, the meringue.

Using crossbody changes was very applicable to dancing at gio's, as it was a very useful way of not crashing into people. Also double (I’ve never seen this word written down, so please forgive me) antrufilos were really fun and a good way to stop the aforementioned crashing into others.

Overall I thought the experience was really enjoyable and I had a lot of fun. I'm kind of sad there hasn't been an event for several weeks, so I’m really excited for the next one!

Course Description
This salsa class explores the cultural, historical, and social underpinnings of salsa dancing through various sources: lectures, readings, dance, and events. The course aims to help students be competent at dancing salsa and learn about its place in society. Students will not be graded on dance ability.

Objectives:
Understand the history and culture of salsa and other social dances.
Discuss social dancing in relation to contemporary society (e.g. gender roles, rebellion, etc).


Course Format: one-hour lecture, one-hour practice
All students (beginner and intermediate) have the same lecture. Lectures will consist of facilitators’ presentations, guest lectures, watching videos (including the movie Dirty Dancing Havana Nights or El Cantante). Students will learn about a variety of topics related to dance as a medium for social interaction between individuals and groups of people. 
Dance! The dance instruction part of each class will be a series taught by the course facilitators and occasional guest instructors. Beginner and intermediate students are taught separately. Beginners who have little or no previous dance experience will be introduced to salsa dancing. Intermediate students will put to practice the fundamental basic steps of salsa dance as well as dive deeper into understanding the basics and their variations.

Course Overview/Grading:
To pass the class, you must complete the following:
Attendance (35% of final grade): 
Have at most 2 absences. (3 tardies = 1 absence)
Arrival 10 minutes late = tardy
Arrival 30 minutes late = absence
Class participation is crucial for the lesson portion of the class.

Write-Ups and Participation (5 points each = 15%) :
Complete 2 Write-Ups. Each student must write two (2) 1-page responses to a salsa social dance event they attended during the semester of taking the DeCal and one about the Dirty Dancing Havana Nights movie.
One talking about a salsa event experience. (On or off campus)
This includes at least three hours of dancing, whether at our events or off-campus. The goal of this is to further introduce students to the art of Latin dance and learn about its culture.
Another one about the Dirty Dancing Havana Nights movie	

Final Presentations (50% of final grade):	
Complete the Final Project for your section.
Submit via email to salsaatcal@gmail.com (please include names + email header!)
Beginners will get into pairs and record a 60 seconds to 1 minute video showing the learned moves plus one new move. OR a 45 second LIVE performance.
Intermediate will also get into pairs and choreograph in front of class a 2 minute dance (including styling, footwork, new moves and a lot of flavor!)

Write Up #2 due Tuesday, May 2nd @11:59pm
 It can be found under the Assignments tab. This is the last written assignment of the course. This write-up is just a short reflection on your experience of social dancing this semester - you can write about the DeCal or any social dance experiences you've had outside of class. You do not need to attend a social dance event outside of class to do this assignment. But, we encourage you all to go out social dancing if you haven't already!

 How To: Teach A Salsa Party Lesson
Written 11.24.2013 by André Crabb
This document goes through what should be taught at a Salsa Party basic lesson. Its good to keep in mind that the audience will be both DeCal students as well as complete beginners. What’s listed below is a good start for anyone’s first lesson who wants to get a feel for what salsa is like.

Note: This should all be completed in 45 min - 1 hour.

Have leaders and follows get in lines, facing each other.
Have the teachers stand in between the lines, also facing each other.
Teach footwork/counting for leaders & follows at the same time.
forward/back basic
side to side basic
back rock basic
Play a song, switching between the basics
Teach the Right Turn footwork, leaders and follows.
Practice it a few times with them.
Play another song, mixing in all basics as well as Right Turns.
Now have them pair up and make a circle around the teachers.
Have them practice their forward/back basic together a little.
Teach the leaders how to lead the Follow’s Right Turn.
Teach leaders how to turn on their own.
Play a song for them to practice.
Teach a different move (and how to get out of it):
Cross Body Lead
Hammerlock
Cuddle
Play a song for them to practice.
The 45 minutes / 1 hour should be over by now. Open it up to social dancing! :D
