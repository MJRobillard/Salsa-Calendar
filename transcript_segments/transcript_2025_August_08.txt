Only ASUC members may hold officer positions in this organization. This section shall not be interpreted to prevent non-ASUC members from holding advisory positions in the organization.

In the event that the designated organization no longer exists or has ceased to be a non-profit organization, the distribution shall be made to the ASUC.

14 This organization shall be considered dissolved if it is inactive and (a) fails to register as a student organization with the University for more than five full academic years or (b) it ceases to have any members.
