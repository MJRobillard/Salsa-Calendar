Musicality & Accents
By: Jose Ordonez and Dhruv Puri

YAY!!!!
What is Musicality?
The quality or state of being musical; feeling and interpreting the music

Dancing to the melody, accents, variations of               rhythm, and mood

Our bodies are to make visible the sounds               we hear
INTERMEDIATE DANCERS LISTEN UP!
MUSICALITY Basics
Energy level           vs        tempo

1  2  3 -  4 
5  6  7    8  

Accents
Performances use them a lot.

Listen to the Music
ACTIVELY listen to the music! On and off the dance floor!

TUNE into the music rather than focusing on patterns and   	 styling

Are you on TIME? do your patterns and styling match the	music, highlight accents, respect the breaks?

The Instruments

Clave
Singer
Timbales
Cowbell
Piano
Bongos
Congas
Guiro
Maracas
Bass
Trumpet
Know the Instruments

Knowing the different instruments
 
how they interact with one another will enhance your ability to stay on time 

enhance your ability/confidence to begin playing with the music


Understand the Structure
Listen to the structure and patterns leading up to breaks, accents, etc..

Know your way around in a song; like you know the 	 different rooms in your house

Know where the bathroom is and how to use it...how to flush...clean up...etc

Don’t potty outside or in your pants...wait for the bathroom to become available

Don’t Ignore the Breaks!
IF the music stops OR slows down, 
THEN drastically slow down or stop halfway…

began your move once the music picks up again 

Adjust your moves to the music



Aaaayyy!!!
Reflect the Mood...
Beyond the structure of a song there is always a certain “feel” to it

The music can “drive” and power you, or get you to relax and chill

Make an emotional connection with the music

A romantic song is likely to be soft and flowy… so feel lovely and sensitive 

Be one with the music
The Clave
A rhythm:
Arguably the most important/core rhythm in salsa.
Clave Rhythm
Son Clave
A group of 2 hits, then a group of 3 hits.
Note: Reverse for “3-2” clave




Clap Along!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsTfm1xIvPA

Rumba Clave
     3rd note of the group of three is late





   Listen: ‘Intro del Mayimbe’ - Mayimbe
Son vs Rumba Clave
Son “2-3”




Rumba
Accents
Ponche
The third clave hit in the group of 3.
Often, the accent is carried to the next measure




What to do?
Step harder, hold your pose a bit longer

Ponche (Cont.)
How do you tell when a ponche is coming?
Listen!

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 … 2 + 3
						  x x             X
		or				  x    x    x    X

	x= hit		X = ponche!		‘…’ = hold

Listen to: ‘Timbamania’ - Mayimbe
Trecillo
Listen: ‘El Diablo’ - Mayimbe (3:20)

Nicholas Burt
	To complete this assignment, I attended a Bachata night at Ashkenaz on the night of October 4th. I also brought along my roommate who is not in the Salsa DeCal and had never danced Bachata prior to the event. What unfolded was a crazy mix of professional dancers and beginners like myself. It honestly was completely different than dancing at the DeCal, a much tougher and difficult process that at times left me unmotivated to continue. Dancers all around me were lite on their feet and could easily string together moves while I mostly danced along the sidelines trying to remember what moves we had been taught in class. I ended up staying for over two and a half hours, getting the full scope of the event.
	The event met my expectations, but in other ways left me frustrated with my lack of knowledge in Salsa and Bachata. Watching other dancers move between dancers with fluidity and ease drove me to make the goal of trying to dance Bachata or Salsa once a week regardless if I made the DeCal. This goal is now paying off as I feel like I am less restrained to the basic step movements and enjoy making moves up on the fly. This was the greatest challenge for me earlier in the semester, where I thought of each move in terms of the individual steps and forgot about the larger picture. Once I had forgotten about the dance, I regressed into my head and would forget the moves in their entirety. After watching the other Bachata dancers, I realized that they just move to the song and don’t worry whether their hitting every mark. Instead, they are embracing the dance for what it is and having fun with it. I now find myself embracing this side of dancing more so than I had previously and have also witnessed a general improvement in my style since. Had I not attended this event, I would never have gained a larger perspective on Salsa and Bachata.

	Before coming to Berkeley, I never went out dancing. When I signed up for this class, I knew I would have to get out of my comfort zone but I did not expect to actually go social dancing. The first event I attended was the Gio’s event. I personally did not feel comfortable and automatically started thinking that social dancing was just not for me. I only stayed for a few minutes and then decided to go home. I feel like the reason I did not get to enjoy myself was because I was still insecure about my dancing ability. Later in the semester, I learned about a different event Salsa at Cal was going to have. At first I did not want to go because I thought it would similar to my last experience. I was then convinced to give social dancing a second chance. 
	
The second event I attended was Salsa at Sproul. The environment was completely different to the that of Gio’s. I was very glad I attended the event because it completely changed my perspective on social dancing. I was able to meet new people, all with different skill levels. I was really surprise when I dance with a guy who had been dancing for most of his life. I told him I was a beginner in advance just so he would know why I wasn't necessarily the best at dancing. He told me that it was fine and went on leading the dance. He did some crazy moves and I was actually able to follow. After dancing with a few guys who were highly skilled, I felt like I had learned more. I felt that I was able to follow more easily and read the signs for certain turns better. I really enjoyed the last social dancing event I attended and can definitely see myself attending more in the future.

A few weeks ago (November 1st) I went to Bachata Nightz at Ashkenaz. I didn’t get there in time for the lesson with Kathy Reyes, but I enjoyed a good 2.5 hours at the social dance part. I think that, for the most part, the event matched the image I had in my head before going. Although the music played in class doesn’t seem like a band is playing it, I typically associate Bachata or any live dance with an accompanying live band. Having DJMigz spin the beats was a really cool experience. It seemed like he incorporated quite a few different styles of bachata, and since we’ve talked about the differences in lecture recently, I was able to listen for them and then joke with my partners about being good enough to try to change the way we danced to match the style/region of the music being played. I think having a DJ over a live band definitely boosted the vibe of a nightclub, which is more youthful and “sexy”, if you will. This vibe made for a great first live exposure for any social dance (besides high school/middle school dances that have their own “dance” culture, lol). I think that Bachata Nightz definitely emulated the social aspect of the dance much better than in class. Having complete strangers come up to me to ask to dance was different and a little intimidating for me at first since dancing, especially bachata, seems like a rather intimate thing to do with a complete stranger, but I also think that’s the beauty behind it. Since there was much less of a focus on technique at Bachata Nightz and I felt comfortable actually following my follow (since they each were pretty experienced), I felt like I could let loose more and focus more on the enjoyment and connection with my partner aspects rather than, “Are we doing this move correctly?” Not following a series of choreography felt less technical, but I also had much more fun. A few of my partners dipped me, which was so awesome for me to do, and I definitely felt more comfortable/experienced than some of the other people there who acted like they had never seen bachata before. Overall, I had a really great time. The environment was super friendly and inviting and my partners were all very laid back and enjoyable. I am looking forward to December 6th (the next Bachata Nightz) very much!!

Sydney Holgado
	Social dancing is quite honestly the motivation with which I applied for this DeCal and joined Salsa at Cal.  My first experience social dancing was far before my first class, when I accidentally stepped onto the dance floor at a salsa club in Madrid.  I was immediately asked to dance and with no idea what the basic step was, I completely embarrassed myself.  Then when I went to my first Open Practica about a year ago I had a goal to use what I would learn to never be that embarrassed again.  I pretty much forgot about that goal until recently when I went social dancing at Ashkenaz for Bachata Nights.   I was on the dance floor being crazily twirled by someone I’d just met and realized that I didn’t care about this whole “embarrassment” thing anymore but instead I was just having so much fun. (This is so cheesy I know sorry). The expectations that I’d set from that first brief experience accidentally social dancing had been shattered over the past year.  
I still get nervous sometimes when I go out and I know that I’m far less experienced than my dance partner, but I’ve tried to build confidence in OP and in the DeCal and the people I’ve met through Salsa at Cal have been instrumental in helping me build that confidence by being patient with me, giving helpful tips, or just hyping me up.  Again this is cheesy and a bit of a ramble but my main takeaway from my social dancing experiences is to not set hard expectations because growing and improving is so fun on its own and happens more when you just go with the flow.

Gregoria Millensifer
	Social dancing is the best part of latin dancing, at least for me it is.  You get to meet new people, try out new moves, enjoy the music, and it’s all such a fun experience.  I have been to a many social dancing nights but the night I reflected on most was Salsa at Cal’s first social event at Gio’s on the twenty-first of September.  The reason why this particular social night ended up being a reflection on social dancing wasn’t because of this paper, but because I got to bring Zac, my boyfriend, and he gave me his perspective of the night as well.  For me, the night was loads of fun; I got to dance with students from the decal and people outside of the class as well.  For Zac, however, the night was bit daunting.
	At the event, I danced with everyone.  I am intermediate at latin dancing, so many times I ended up dancing with someone who knew more moves than I did.  Whenever someone led me into a new move and I messed up, they would let me know what they were trying to do and lead it again so that we may try again.  When I would complete the moves, I felt very accomplished.  I also danced with students from the DeCal, and we would laugh together if we messed up and give ourselves praise when we completed moves we learned in the class.
During the night, I realized that social dancing wasn’t such an exhilarating experience I thought it was to everyone because Zac seemed nervous.  We had been to open practicas before, but this night ended up being more chaotic for him.  He told me that he felt nervous about his dancing because he was a beginner and felt that he was not a good enough dancer.  I dragged his booty to the dance floor and told him all he needed was the basic steps and a good mood.  Because it was difficult for me to teach him new moves as a intermediate follower, we ended up sticking to the basics, which he perfected by the end of the night.  It was fun to teach him the moves I had learned and the night ended up being a great experience for the both of us, regardless of experience.

Hello,

My name is Gregoria, I'm a board member of Salsa at Cal I recently heard about [recent even the club did] and I wanted to learn more about [club].   I think it would be great for our communities to connect and support each other at Berkeley. 

A little about us, Salsa at Cal is a family of dancers who are looking to grow our Latin Dance community. We offer free events and dance lessons for people of all levels. We also have social nights where we try to reach out to the greater Berkeley community. 

As a growing community, we would love to welcome members of [insert club here] to our next meeting or a coffee chat.  Let me know if you might be interested and we can setup some times. 

Best Regards,
Gregoria and the Salsa At Cal Familia

My most recent dancing experience outside of the Salsa DeCal was the Fall Fiesta at Gio’s on October 19. It was definitely different from dancing at the DeCal or even from dancing during office hours. The dancing was structureless, energetic, and quicker which I really enjoyed though I had a hard time keeping up with the more experienced dancers. 
I think this event did just about meet my expectations. It was my first time at Gio’s so I didn’t really know what to expect. The venue was very nice and the environment was very lively and entertaining. I arrived two hours after the event started; I missed the one hour lesson and the first hour of social dancing. Once I arrived, there wasn’t any salsa or bachata songs playing until about 4-5 songs later. However, it was great to hear how the music varied. I think that made the event much more enjoyable and energetic, it allowed myself and other explore different types of dancing.
I applied essentially everything I learned in lecture and from dance class. All my moves came from dance class but by dancing with others, I did learn a few new moves and learned to more easily adjusted to different styles and rhythms. I really enjoyed being able to dance with people with different levels of experience. I learned so much from this event and I think I even left feeling a little more confident in my dancing abilities. Now, I certainly understand when the DeCal instructors say that social dancing helps make a dancer. 
Though this event was not exactly how I imagined it would be, I really enjoyed myself and would not turn down the chance to attend another salsa at Gio’s event. I believe the Salsa DeCal really prepared me for this social event and I am looking forward to checking out future social dancing events, including dancing something other than salsa.

	To complete this assignment, I attended a Bachata night at Ashkenaz on the night of October 4th. I also brought along my roommate who is not in the Salsa DeCal and had never danced Bachata prior to the event. What unfolded was a crazy mix of professional dancers and beginners like myself. It honestly was completely different than dancing at the DeCal, a much tougher and difficult process that at times left me unmotivated to continue. Dancers all around me were lite on their feet and could easily string together moves while I mostly danced along the sidelines trying to remember what moves we had been taught in class. I ended up staying for over two and a half hours, getting the full scope of the event.
	The event met my expectations, but in other ways left me frustrated with my lack of knowledge in Salsa and Bachata. Watching other dancers move between dancers with fluidity and ease drove me to make the goal of trying to dance Bachata or Salsa once a week regardless if I made the DeCal. This goal is now paying off as I feel like I am less restrained to the basic step movements and enjoy making moves up on the fly. This was the greatest challenge for me earlier in the semester, where I thought of each move in terms of the individual steps and forgot about the larger picture. Once I had forgotten about the dance, I regressed into my head and would forget the moves in their entirety. After watching the other Bachata dancers, I realized that they just move to the song and don’t worry whether their hitting every mark. Instead, they are embracing the dance for what it is and having fun with it. I now find myself embracing this side of dancing more so than I had previously and have also witnessed a general improvement in my style since. Had I not attended this event, I would never have gained a larger perspective on Salsa and Bachata.

To gain dance experience outside of the decal and open practica, I attended Salsa on Sproul on October 12th. Even though it was still on campus, it felt different from dancing at the decal. Instead of the usual people and moves from class every week, I met new people who danced with moves and styles I had never seen before. In addition, I danced with people at very different levels than my own; some taught me new moves and others had never danced salsa before. When a bachata song came on, my partner had never heard of bachata before so I got to show them a little bit of what I had learned from the decal. 
On the other hand, it was also fun to apply what I already knew. The first hour lesson was entirely things that the beginner class had already learned before, so I got to help some people figure out the moves and to keep improving on what I’d learned. I also was able to apply information from lecture; a cuban song came on before we had been taught any cuban moves, but by the way my partner was dancing I could tell we were doing cuban salsa from the lecture on different styles of dance! Having a partner that knew how to do cuban salsa was a cool experience because he was able to teach me a series of different moves. 
Overall, the event definitely met my expectations. I was nervous to dance on Sproul in front of other students walking by, but once the music started playing that all went away. I felt like I learned a lot of new things and applied all of the old knowledge I had and wasn’t afraid to mess up in front of other people! While the decal never feels limiting, the more social environment of salsa on sproul made me feel less limited to the moves and partners I know and feel like I was able to jump in and learn new things along the way. Next up is being able to make it to a Gio’s night!

	I went to the salsa on sproul event, where people from the decal and others social danced on the steps of sproul. The event started off with a lesson on basics and then moved on to social dancing. I found social dancing to be much more difficult than dancing in the decal because in the decal we usually learn combos and practice those which allows me to kind of have planned what to do. In social dancing it was much more on the fly and I found it more difficult to time and execute  different combos. Also leading was more difficult because in practice everyone shares a common knowledge of the combos and the followers know what’s coming next. In social dancing I found that I need to be much more clear as a lead in signaling what move is coming next. 
	The event was a lot of fun and definitely met my expectations. It was also fun to dance with people form the beginners class as the two classes usually don’t mix that often. I applied a lot of the moves that we have learned in class but found that a lot of them were more difficult than normal because of the limited space available. In class we have a lot of space to due the spins and all the different moves that are necessary form combos, however at the salsa on sproul event there were a lot more people and I had to learn to take smaller steps when dancing. Something that I did not expect to be so difficult that I struggled with was always staying on the 1 beat throughout the whole song. Especially if there was a slight mess up and we became offbeat I found it more difficult than expected to get back on. I think practicing in social settings is definitely one of the best ways to improve and sort of one of the only ways to identify what you need to improve on. 
	Overall I had a great time at salsa on sproul and thought it was a great way to sort of introduce salsa at cal to people on campus. I noticed a lot of people stopping to watch and even participate in the dancing!
