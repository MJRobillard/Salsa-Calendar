Approved by (LEAD Center staff):

ARTICLE I : Title
This organization is called Salsa at Cal.

ARTICLE II : Purpose
Salsa at Cal will promote salsa dance by organizing and hosting classes and dance events.

ARTICLE III : Membership
All currently registered UC Berkeley students may be “active members” of the club. Only active members may vote or hold office. However, faculty, staff, alumni and off-campus participants may take part in club activities as “non-active” members. Only currently registered students, faculty, and staff may be active members in a registered student organization. Only active members may vote or hold office. We will not haze according to California State Law. We will not restrict membership based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy (including pregnancy, childbirth, and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth), physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or service in the uniformed services (including membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services).

ARTICLE IV : Officers/Elections
The executive committee will include the following positions: President, Vice President, Event Coordinator, Publicity Coordinator, and Finance Coordinator. Roles for each position are as follows:

President: Calls meetings and sets agenda, is the primary signatory, is the primary contact and spokesperson of the club, and performs whatever duties are not delegated to others. Manages the running of the club and the Board. Promptly handles and responds to club emails, as well as moderates and administers the listserv. Should become a ASUC agent.

Vice President: Acts as President in his or her absence and performs other incidental tasks that may need to be done. Is in charge of class-related communication and paperwork. In charge of all our equipment (e.g. speakers, lights, etc.) In charge of recruitment and retention of active and board members. Also maintains organization of the club’s documents. Should become a signatory.

Finance Coordinator: Handles club funds and reimbursement. Is an ASUC agent and signatory. Is in charge of accepting and setting budgets for events, equipment, flyers, etc. In charge of filling out mid-year and yearly report for ASUC funding.

Publicity Coordinator: Is responsible for flyering, tabling, graphic design, and any other activities intended to promote the club and its events. Sends the weekly email announcements to members regarding club meetings or general activities coordinated by the club. Must become signatory.


When vacancies arise in the board, (previous board members will recommend new members to become officers) new officers will be selected through an application and interview process by the existing officers. Members will be invited to submit a written application for the position, which the existing officers will review as a group. They will then offer interviews to the applicants of their choice and select a new officer from them. 

Unless circumstances are extenuating, new officer selection will be done at the beginning each semester, following which the outgoing officers will train their replacements for the remainder of the semester, and the new officers will begin their terms the following semester. An officer may be removed from office by a two-thirds majority vote of the executive committee, or by a two-thirds majority vote of the active members. Members must be notified at least two weeks in advance of such a vote.

ARTICLE V : Meetings
The board members and any active members who wish to attend will meet weekly to plan events and discuss club issues. The President will call the meetings. The qourum (i.e. the minimum number of members present such that the proceedings at that meeting are valid) is three. Meeting times will be decided by consensus among the officers and/or active members, and members will be notified via email of the time and location of each meeting. There will not be a call for special emergency meetings. 

ARTICLE VI : Constitutional Amendments
A constitutional amendment may be proposed by any active member and should be presented at a meeting in writing. If a member wishes to propose an amendment at a meeting, he or she should notify the officers, who will then notify the members via email. Members must be notified of a vote on an amendment at least two weeks before the vote is to be held. An amendment, addition, or deletion requires a two-thirds majority vote by the active members in order to pass. All amendments, additions or deletions to this document must be filed with the LEAD Center in 102 Hearst Gym.



ARTICLE VII : Dissolution
A two-thirds majority of the active members may vote to dissolve the group. Members must be notified via email at least two weeks before such a vote is held. If the group is dissolved, all unspent ASUC funds shall remain the property of the ASUC; all Graduate Assembly funds shall remain the property of the Graduate Assembly. Remaining privately-obtained funds may be donated to another nonprofit organization with prior approval of the ASUC Senate Finance Committee.

EMAIL SUMMARY

sdacboard@googlegroups.com - email this address to reach the board
salsadanceatcal@lists.berkeley.edu - this is to reach everyone that’s signed up
salsadanceatcal@gmail.com - password: salsa2011   - use this account to reach the entire club, give it out when people want to reach you about club stuff
salsadecal@gmail.com - password: salsa2011    - use this account to reach the decal

Note: salsadanceatcal and salsadecal are two separate accounts, but are connected, so you can sign into either, and see the email of the other as well as send as the other.

STARTING UP THE DECAL: semesterly basis
Paperwork: You will want to be in touch with Rebecca Chavez (rebeccaisme@berkeley.edu), who handles our paperwork.
http://www.decal.org/start-a-course/seven-steps/ This is useful, but starting last semester, the paperwork for the Spring 2012 semester has changed, and this is the link: http://vpapf.chance.berkeley.edu/specialstudies/Course_Proposal_Packet.pdf
Some tips: 
we offer both the 98 and 198 course  
instructor of record name: Mary Kelsey (mkelsey@berkeley.edu)
The first four questions should be on the syllabus (which you should revise each semester to fit these requirements – I’ve already revised it to fit Spring 2012 – or at least change the date so the DeCal board thinks we’ve been making changes)
Question 5 will require an answer on a separate page
In addition to this sheet, you will also need to fill out the second page of the Independent Study Application (already uploaded in the gdoc folder under School Forms). This is the breakdown:
Class time: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Reading: 1 hr/wk x 15 wks
Presentations: 10 hrs/presentation x 1 presentation
Writing: 2.5 hrs/journal x 2 journals
IF the required amount of hours for a unit changes, make changes accordingly!
You will also need to submit the syllabus (also uploaded under school forms, entitled Salsa Syllabus F11 v2)
Make sure you get Mary Kelsey (454 Barrows) to sign everything!
Submit the forms to Rebecca, who is next door to Mary (door to the left).
Rebecca will most likely give the paperwork herself to the DeCal board, but just in case, make 2ish copies for yourselves in case somebody needs it and Rebecca has the paperwork.
If she asks, 30 is the target enrollment
Do NOT ask for CECs, open CCNs are fine
Difference: open CCNs mean you just give those who make it into the decal the different CCNs (one for the 98, another for 198) and CECs means each person has an entry code and is a huge hassle, especially if one drops or whatever.
Room scheduling:
Rebecca will give you a 30-person room. KEEP THIS ROOM, as if the campus room scheduling falls through, you will need this room.
You should also reserve a room as a student group. The bigger the possible… You know the drill. 
Arcy, you said you might be able to do this via caucus? This would be grand, because you know how we have many problems doing this.
The online form is at http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/studentgrps.html 
This is on a first-come, first-served basis so this must be done quickly!
IF YOU ARE DOING THIS IN THE FALL SEMESTER, make sure there are 4 signatories prior to this because all clubs have to be revalidated before the academic year starts.
For the room in Hearst Gym, contact Brent Atkinson. His email is brentuc@berkeley.edu and his phone number is 510-643-0604. Email him first –Kevin says he is slow to respond, but he responded within 9ish days for me—but if he doesn’t respond, email again. And if he doesn’t respond then, call him.
Say that the salsa DECAL (and not club) needs Hearst Gym, but we will actually be using it for Tuesday classes, so tell him you want it on Tuesdays. This is the template I used when emailing him:
Hi Brent,

I am the new facilitator of the Salsa Dance DeCal this coming year(semester). We’ll be doing the DeCal once again in the Fall(Spring), and would like to use Hearst. Our top choices would be 8-10pm on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. Please let me know if this would work. Thanks for your help!

Sincerely,
Jenna Hang
Email him early on – now would be the opportune time.
He may ask for a copy of the DeCal paperwork – if so, give him a copy.
Eshelman Space Allocation: turn in the paperwork before the end of April (end of spring semester) to have a space for the following academic year.
DeCal website: The DeCal board will send you information regarding how to access the website in the fall.
Since this is the spring semester, you may have to log in with my info from last semester – if this is the case, the information is
Login: jenna.hang@berkeley.edu
pw: 6a4b8f4be
Admissions Process
Set up an application using Google Forms – this will have a form like one you usually see, but all the information will come into the Google Excel doc. This is the doc you see when we read the apps. Just use the same questions as years previous, but if you would like to, make up your own.
Come time to choose who is in the DeCal, cap it at 24 students; 12 leads and 12 followers. This leaves room for 6 more students to be on the waitlist (3 leads and 3 follows). This was complicated last year because we did not leave room for a waitlist.
BE ON TOP OF YOUR EMAILS at this time. Once you have determined who will be on what, give them the CCNs. They are in the email from Rebecca that I forwarded to each of you.
Don’t start too early. We started everything within the first two weeks of class, and this is bad timing – people are still unsure if they can stay in the DeCal. Hold the first day of class (which is really the info session) about the third week of school, and then have applications due a week later. This gives people time to hear about the club and we don’t have to scramble holding 3 different info sessions. I also foresee less drops from the accepted applicants if we do it this way.
Once the DeCal has started, the assignments and everything have already been uploaded. Kevin also has a doc filled with the emails he sent out each week – I used them, made a few changes, so plan accordingly. I have added the email I sent out for the different styles of salsa lecture that we had this semester – it is up to you if you would like to keep that topic or change it.
Send out the history of salsa reading/syllabus before the first official day of class. They should have already read everything before the first day, so that they are ready for the lecture.
Make a decal list-serve if you’d like. I did it because I was too lazy to input 30 emails every time I sent an email. Make sure to CC the other coords though so they know what’s up.
STARTING UP/MAINTAINING THE CLUB
Cal Day is nice, but I don’t think it is a big concern because they are prospective students. We get most of our members from Calapalooza in the fall semester.
I don’t know if this is a yearly thing, but I had to revise the constitution and turn it in at the end of the year last year, but it may have been because we had changed our name from Social Ballroom Club to Salsa Dance at Cal, and then to just Salsa Dance.
CHECK ON THIS, because this is a hazy area for me.
The constitution should be uploaded already.

The Big Give 2025 Alumni Email
Dear {{Name}},
Hope you’re doing well! We are the new generation of UC Berkeley's Salsa@Cal and we are excited to reach out to our great network of alumni! If you didn’t know, there is an annual fundraiser offered by the university called “The Big Give” which is an opportunity to receive donations from family, friends, and alumni. This fundraiser will begin tonight (03/12/25) at 9PM PDT. This event only runs for 24 hours. Salsa@Cal could really use your support! 
We all know how special this club is—memories of late-night social dancing, prepping for performances, or just the amazing people we’ve met along the way. Since the 2020 pandemic, we have rebuilt our club from the ground up, experiencing significant growth, and are now recognized as a Latin dancing community on campus. Our mission is to gain recognition throughout the Bay Area and beyond! 
Your generous donations will help support initiatives such as organizing additional social events, providing Salsa@Cal merchandise, funding workshops, and covering costs for costumes and studio rentals for performances.
Please consider donating—every little bit helps! Here is the link:
https://givingday.berkeley.edu/giving-day/90821/donate?dept=102168
In addition to our fundraising efforts, this email also serves as an opportunity to get to know our alumni personally in order to build stronger relationships. If you are interested in reconnecting, we would be delighted to invite you to some of our upcoming events!
We’d love to keep the Salsa@Cal spirit alive for future dancers, and it means a lot to have alumni like you cheering us on. Hope to see you on the dance floor again sometime!
Take care,
Salsa@Cal

--------------------
FALL 25 BOARD APPLICATION

Timeline
- COMMITTEE APPLICATION DUE SATURDAY, AUGUST 22nd @11:59PM 
- DECISIONS OUT ON AUGUST 25th!

Salsa at Cal Committee Members will meet on a date below*

WHAT IS SALSA AT CAL? (not that you guys need an introduction)
Salsa at Cal is a group of university students who would like to spread their appreciation and knowledge of salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus and to the surrounding community. We primarily function as a Registered Student Organization, DeCal, and dance/cultural community. 
We teach a weekly series of beginner and intermediate classes in Hearst Gym as part of our for-credit DeCal course for students only. As an RSO, we host dance events, trips to local clubs, and FREE classes in Salsa and other styles. We are also open to performance bookings and host private classes upon request. We've taught everything from Rueda Cubana to Bachata, but our main focus is on Salsa. Dancers of all levels--from complete beginners looking to learn for the first time, to seasoned Salseres just looking for a fun crowd to dance with--are welcome in our classes and events, and no partner is required. 
As a club, Salsa at Cal strives to create spaces in which Latine students can learn, grow, and celebrate our experiences through social dancing; while also providing all students of different backgrounds the opportunity to respect, experience, and learn about Latin music, culture, and dance. 
--------------------------------------
Committees
 
External Affairs    Led by Emmanuel Ceja and Rene Gallegos
External Affairs is tasked with ensuring the successful execution of events Salsa at Cal will be a part of. We are responsible for responding to collaboration requests from other organizations and completing the work necessary to see it through. In this committee we are looking for people who are organized, reliable, good with interpersonal relations, and interested in helping Salsa at Cal grow and host more events for the Berkeley community. 

Internal Affairs    Led by Matthew Robillard
Internal Affairs serves as the basis of communication between not only other committees but also general club members. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: staying up to date with filtering and forwarding email to each respective committee (answering questions when able); organizing/ coordinating internal club events, social gatherings, and any other activities related to club engagement and bonding; attending and taking notes of general and/or board meetings; help running communication channels; working closely with Finance committee and staying up-to-date with the ASUC body. 

Marketing    Led by Kacey Yoe
The Marketing Committee is looking for people to contribute to building Salsa at Cal's brand within the UC Berkeley community and beyond! We take on projects that fall into Content Creation, Publicity, and Communications. Content Creation tackles documentation and editing for lifestyle and promotional content on our social media platforms. Publicity deals with Salsa at Cal’s advertising, promoting the club offline and online through on-campus tabling and Instagram graphics. Communications organizes our monthly newsletters and calendars to keep our internal and external community well-connected. You will have the opportunity to focus on one or multiple aspects of Marketing, collaborate with other Salsa at Cal committees, and enhance your creativity, communication, and technical skills.



CAL Latin Fusion Team  Led by Kathy Reyes
Our Performance Team enables intermediate and advanced dancers to take their skills to the next level in a performance setting. Our performance team is led by Kathy Reyes and places greater emphasis dancing technique and fundamentals then many of our other offerings, which are often geared towards social dancing. Performance team members dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to mastering the choreography, which extends far beyond memorizing a series of patterns. 
Our current performance is a Latin Fusion team, which mixes different types of Latin and Afro dance through choreography. To find out more about our team, feel free to contact us through our email
If interested in the performance committee, you will also be required to join a performance orientation on September 6th at 1PM

Finance    Led by Daniela V
The Finance Committee is looking for people who have a passion for finance for Salsa@Cal. As a member, you'll take on a pivotal role or roles, such as developing and maintaining budgets for Salsa@Cal events, fundraising events, keeping record of expenses, purchasing merchandise, and communication among committee members. Additionally, you'll play a vital role in securing sponsorships, and identifying and applying for relevant grants to support our dance initiatives. As a Finance Committee member, you'll not only manage the financial aspects of our club but also have the exciting responsibility of setting and achieving financial goals for fun and memorable club experiences such as retreats and get togethers! 

If you have any questions about Salsa at Cal in general, please reach out to our President or send us an email at: salsaatcal@gmail.com

I want to join the Decal but it’s too late

Hi [NAME],

Unfortunately, our DeCal applications closed on Friday, [DATE], and our enrollment forms are already finalized. However, you are more than welcome to apply next semester. Otherwise, you will still get opportunities to dance and be part of our community through the events we host throughout the semester!

We host Open Prácticas every Tuesday night from 8:30 to 10 PM under the Social Science Tunnel. No partner or prior experience is required! Each session begins with a beginner-friendly lesson, making it the perfect opportunity to learn and dance. We hope to see you there!

You can keep up with what we have going on through our Instagram or our mailing list. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

--------------------
PERFORMANCE INTERVIEWS 

What is Ari looking for in Performers?
+ Notes disclaimer
+ Rundown of interview/explanation of purpose 
+ Introduction - sets a friendly base 
+ asks for introduction about him → notes interest in applicant as well 
+ asks availability for practice times
+ integrates feedback
+ asks how they feel about performing the responsibilities involved in role – is specific
+ catches comments they make and builds up on them 
+ clarifies any questions at the end 


Wants to join because he misses to dance and used to dance a lot in Peru 
Applying as a Lead 
Doesn’t feel stressed about it because likes to do it, so will make “as much time as you need” 
More about experience on salsa and bachata and how he feels about PERFORMING both: 
Dances since a kid, did a lot of social dancing growing up 
ABOUT PERFORMING → has NEVER performed for others, but is enthusiastic about doing it and sees it as a “privilege” 
Performances: knows many steps and thinks he could contribute a lot of steps that he we don’t know, he is comfortable with sharing them with us 
What would he contribute if accepted: share knowledge of new steps and also participation in ALL the meetings we have, all the practices, would be very committed.
More about practicing choreography to perform, vs. social dancing, are you okay with this? → i think it is different, but i am okay with it, and i think i am happy with it because i've never done it and it's a new experience
