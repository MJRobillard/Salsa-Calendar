Hi Salsero/a/e!

CONGRATULATIONS! You have been accepted into the Salsa at Cal DeCal BEGINNER COURSE this semester as a LEAD.

We will have our first class this Tuesday, September 12th from 7pm-8pm in Hearst Gym 242.
Please remember it is mandatory attendance. If you fail to attend the first class you will be dropped and someone from the waitlist will take your spot in the course. 

Attendance Policy 
Please remember that attendance is crucial for this course as we need to have even numbers of leads and follows for each class to run smoothly. Excused absences in the future are permitted on a case-by-case basis, but if you will not be able to consistently attend class for the entire assigned beginner time block, please inform us by email no later than Monday, September 11th at midnight; if this is the case, we will have to drop you from the course and give your spot to a waitlisted student. IF you decide that you no longer want to take the class, you must inform us no later than Monday, September 11th at midnight since we are doing the enrollment process for you through our sponsoring department.

Unfortunately, auditing the class is not an option under these circumstances. However, if you are not able to attend the DeCal this semester, there are other Salsa at Cal events that will be hosted later in the semester that we encourage you to attend!

Office Hours
We host Office Hours every Tuesday after class from 9PM-10PM in Social Sciences Building 402. It’s super casual and fun, we hope to see you there! 

Enrollment Logistics 
By Friday September 15th, you should have been enrolled into SOCIOL198 on CalCentral and you should have gotten a notification on bCourses that you have been enrolled in SOCIOL 198 (History, Culture and Practice of Salsa Dance). If you have not been enrolled by then, please let us know. All late fees waived. 


Thank you for applying - we are excited to dance with you!



Dear Salsa DeDal Applicant,


We are sorry to inform you that we are unable to offer you a spot in this semester’s Salsa at Cal DeCal. 


This Fall 2023 semester, we received 190 Beginner Section applications, with a capacity to host only 36. Please know we appreciate your interest in this class and the time you put into applying for our DeCal. We reviewed all applications exhaustively. Unfortunately, there was a high volume of applicants and we had to decline many students who applied; auditing the class is not an option under current circumstances. However, we strongly encourage you to reapply next semester and stay connected with us on social media to get updates on all future events and other opportunities to dance with Salsa at Cal outside of our DeCal! 

We are flattered by your interest in our DeCal and the amazing art that is Latin dance. Thank you for the effort you put into applying.

Course Description
This salsa class explores the cultural, historical, and social underpinnings of salsa dancing through various sources: lectures, readings, dance, and events.

Course Format: one-hour lecture, one-hour practice
All students (beginner and intermediate) have the same lecture. Lectures will consist of facilitators’ presentations, guest lectures, watching videos (including the movie Dirty Dancing Havana Nights or El Cantante). Students will learn about a variety of topics related to dance as a medium for social interaction between individuals and groups of people. 
Dance! The dance instruction part of each class will be a series taught by the course facilitators and occasional guest instructors. Beginner and intermediate students are taught separately. Beginners who have little or no previous dance experience will be introduced to salsa dancing. Intermediate students will put to practice the fundamental basic steps of salsa dance as well as dive deeper into understanding the basics and their variations.

Course Overview/Grading:
To pass the class, you must complete the following:

Beginners will get into pairs and record a 60 seconds to 1 minute video showing the learned moves plus one new move. OR a 45 second LIVE performance.

Asking Someone to Dance
Be clear on who you’re asking.
Ask one partner at a time.
Ask as many people as possible!
Make eye contact, be inviting, and offer your hand.
If declined:
Don’t take it personally
Ask someone else
Ask at the beginning of a song

Declining
If you respond “next song,” mean it!

Don’t decline someone and then accept someone else for the same song

Try to accept as many dances as possible!

Polite ways to decline:
“No thank you”
“No thank you, I’m taking a break”
“No thank you, I’m getting a drink”


Activity:
Asking someone
to dance!
During the Dance
Dance at the level of your partner
Make beginners feel comfortable
Dancing with a wide variety of dancers at different levels makes you better!
Try to avoid teaching others or asking for lessons on the dance floor.
Be aware of your surroundings. 
Don’t take more floor space than you need.
Apologize if you bump another couple.
During the Dance
Enjoy yourself!
Smile!
Small talk/asking their name is okay
Eye contact is a good thing (but don’t stare!)
If you’re feelin it, sing it!

DON’T:
Say: “Wow, this is a long song!”
Count out loud
Stare at your feet

If you feel uncomfortable, its OK to walk away.
After the Dance
Say “thank you”
You can ask for another dance later!

Don’t give unsolicited dancing advice

If you are exchanging numbers, move off the dancefloor
Remember:
Be yourself!
Don’t compare yourself to others!
Have fun!
