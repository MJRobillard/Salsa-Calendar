RSO Information
Salsa at Cal is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at UC Berkeley, which was founded in 2009 by dancers who branched off from the Ballroom team at Cal. Initially, it was considered naming the club the "Social Ballroom Club" before changing to "Salsa Dance at Cal". The organization aims to promote salsa and other Latin dances by organizing and hosting classes and dance events.
Membership is open to all currently registered UC Berkeley students as "active members", who have voting and office-holding rights. Faculty, staff, alumni, and off-campus participants can join as "non-active" members. The organization prohibits hazing and does not restrict membership based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or service in the uniformed services.
Salsa at Cal is ASUC-sponsored and adheres to ASUC Bylaw 2201, Schedule A, which outlines various regulations regarding its non-profit operation, use of ASUC funds for student welfare, financial obligations, and other policies. For general inquiries, you can reach them at salsaatcal@gmail.com.
DeCal Course Details
Salsa at Cal offers a 1-unit, Pass/No Pass (P/NP) DeCal course titled "History, Culture and Practice of Salsa Dance". No prior experience or partner is necessary to enroll.
The course explores the cultural, historical, and social foundations of salsa dancing through lectures, readings, dance instruction, and events. It aims to develop students' salsa dancing competence and understanding of its societal role, though students are not graded on dance ability.
Academic Structure:
• The class typically involves a one-hour lecture/discussion and a one-hour dance instruction portion. In Fall 2022, it was one hour of practice supplemented by online material and discussion.
• Beginner and Intermediate sections are taught separately.
• Lectures cover topics such as History of Salsa, Music Fundamentals, Etiquette, Gender Roles, Fashion, Salsa Styles, Musicality and Accents, and Salsa Artists. The course often includes watching movies like "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights" or "El Cantante".
• The instruction primarily focuses on LA style salsa, emphasizing structure, form, and promoting respect and consent while avoiding traditional gender roles in leading and following.
• "Salsistants" (assistants), who are expected to know both lead and follow basics, provide additional help and one-on-one feedback to students. They may receive 1-2 units of P/NP credit for their commitment.
Learning Outcomes & Prerequisites for Intermediate:
• Beginners are introduced to salsa dancing.
• Intermediate students delve deeper into fundamental basic steps and their variations.
• Concepts and moves expected for intermediate students include: counting 1-2-3 5-6-7, basic steps (LA, Side, Rockstep), basic Left/Right Turns, Cross-body Lead, Back Break, Hammerlock, and Lead/Follow communication (tension, signals).
Attendance and Grading:
• Attendance is mandatory, with a limit of 2 absences (3 tardies count as 1 absence).
• Write-Ups (15% of final grade): Two 1-page responses are required: one reflecting on a social dance event (on or off-campus, at least three hours of dancing), and another reflecting on the movie "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights".
• Final Presentations (50-60% of final grade):
    ◦ Beginners perform a 60-second to 1-minute video demonstrating learned moves plus one new move, or a 45-second live performance.
    ◦ Intermediate students choreograph and perform a 2-minute dance, incorporating styling, footwork, new moves, and "flavor".
The course is supervised by Professor Mary Kelsey from the Sociology Department.
Competitive Team Information
Salsa at Cal started its first Performance Team in Spring 2015. This team is for intermediate and advanced dancers who want to advance their skills in a performance setting. The performance team emphasizes dancing technique and fundamentals over social dancing, and members commit significant time and effort to mastering choreography beyond just memorizing patterns.
The current performance team is a Latin Fusion team, which blends various Latin and Afro dance styles through choreography, and is led by Kathy Reyes. There is also a Rueda team, and mentions of Colombian Salsa and Bachata teams. Auditions are held after the first month of the semester, and a limit of 2 absences is allowed for team members.
Salsa at Cal is open to performance bookings and private classes upon request. Performance interviews assess commitment to practicing choreography for performances, rather than just social dancing.

    2. Content Strategy Questions
Audience & Messaging
• Primary Audience: Salsa at Cal primarily targets UC Berkeley students. The organization aims to spread appreciation and knowledge of salsa and other Latin dances to students on campus and the surrounding community. They cater to dancers of all levels, from complete beginners to seasoned Salseros looking for a fun crowd. The DeCal course is specifically for students, while Open Practica and social events are open to everyone, often attracting both students and the broader Berkeley community. The club also has a focus on creating spaces where Latine students can learn, grow, and celebrate their experiences, while providing all students the opportunity to respect, experience, and learn about Latin music, culture, and dance. They aim to serve underrepresented communities on campus.
• Value Proposition: Salsa at Cal distinguishes itself by being a student-run Registered Student Organization (RSO) and DeCal. Key value propositions include:
    ◦ Free events and dance lessons for people of all levels.
    ◦ A focus on building a strong Latin dancing community on campus and beyond, often described as a "family" of dancers.
    ◦ The provision of a for-credit DeCal course for UC Berkeley students covering history, culture, and practice of salsa dance.
    ◦ Weekly Open Practicas that include a dance lesson and social dancing, requiring no partner or prior experience.
    ◦ Emphasis on respect and consent in all dance instruction.
    ◦ Opportunities for social dancing beyond classes, including trips to local clubs and on-campus events like Salsa on Sproul.
    ◦ Provision of a safe and inclusive space for self-expression through dance.
• Tone & Voice: The content generally strikes a welcoming and enthusiastic tone. Phrases like "YAY!!!!", "WELCOME :-)", "We are soooooo back", and "THANK YOU EVERYONE :^)" appear in presentations and notes. The club aims to build a safe and comfortable inner board community and maintain a cordial and positive tone in written communication. Communication also highlights the fun and enjoyment aspects of dancing. For marketing, phrases like "Be loud, be clear" for tabling etiquette indicate an energetic approach.
• Multilingual Needs: While not explicitly stated as a general policy for all content, the inherent nature of Latin dance and cultural events suggests an implied need. The club promotes Latin music, culture, and dance. Some lecture topics include "Salsa Artists" and "History of Salsa", and the movie "El Cantante" has been shown in the DeCal, suggesting an embrace of the Spanish-speaking cultural roots. The names of many events and dance moves are also in Spanish (e.g., "Salsaween," "Salsa Tropi-Cal," "El Mercadito," "Dile Que No," "Enchufla").
